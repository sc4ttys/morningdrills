14,,3,Explain the purpose of Control Plane Policing (CoPP) in BGP security.,CoPP protects the router's control plane from DoS attacks by rate-limiting traffic to the control plane. This prevents the route processor from being overwhelmed by malicious or unnecessary traffic.
15,,3,What is the BGP maximum prefix feature,and why is it important?The BGP maximum prefix feature limits the number of prefixes received from a neighbor to prevent a single neighbor from exhausting router resources. If the number of received prefixes exceeds the limit the BGP session is terminated to protect the router.
16,,4,How can prefix filtering with prefix lists enhance BGP security?,Prefix filtering with prefix lists ensures that only legitimate routes are accepted or advertised. This prevents the addition of unwanted or illegitimate routes to the BGP routing table.
17,,4,Describe the process of configuring prefix filtering on a Cisco router.,On a Cisco router prefix filtering is configured by creating a prefix list and applying it to a BGP neighbor in the inbound or outbound direction.

They are configured using regular expressions and applied to BGP neighbors.
19,,4,How is BGP neighbor authentication configured on Cisco and Juniper devices?,On Cisco devices BGP neighbor authentication is configured using the command: `neighbor [ip-address] password [password]`. On Juniper devices it involves creating a key-chain object with the password and linking it to the BGP group.
20,,4,What is the BGP TTL security check,and how is it configured on Cisco and Juniper routers?The BGP TTL security check protects against DoS attacks by setting an expected TTL value for incoming packets. Cisco command: `neighbor [ip-address] ttl-security hops [hop-count]`. Juniper command: `set neighbor [neighbor-ip-address] multihop ttl [ttl-value]`.
21,,3,Why is logging important in BGP,and how can it be enabled on Cisco and Juniper devices?Logging BGP neighbor activities helps monitor unauthorized changes and troubleshoot network issues. On Cisco use `bgp log-neighbor-changes`. On Juniper use `set log-updown` within the BGP configuration.
22,,4,Explain the significance of aggregation in BGP and provide an example of how it is configured on a Cisco router.,Aggregation reduces the number of prefixes in the routing table by announcing a larger address block. Example configuration: `router bgp 64511` `address-family ipv4` `network [aggregate-address] mask [mask]` `ip route [aggregate-address] [mask] null0`.
23,,3,What is the impact of not aggregating routes in BGP?,Not aggregating routes can lead to routing table bloat increased routing churn and longer convergence times impacting the stability and performance of the Internet.

33,,6,Explain the concept of DHCP snooping and its benefits.,DHCP snooping is a security feature that acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and the DHCP server. It validates DHCP messages and maintains a binding table of legitimate DHCP leases. This helps prevent attacks like DHCP spoofing and DHCP starvation by ensuring that only trusted DHCP servers can assign IP addresses.
34,,6,What is the purpose of DHCP relay and how does it work?,DHCP relay is used to forward DHCP messages between clients and servers when they are not on the same subnet. A relay agent receives DHCP broadcasts from clients encapsulates them in unicast messages and forwards them to the DHCP server. The server's responses are then relayed back to the clients.
35,,6,How do you configure a DHCP relay agent on a Cisco router?,To configure a DHCP relay agent on a Cisco router: 1. Enable DHCP relay: `interface [interface]` `ip helper-address [DHCP-server-IP]`. This command forwards DHCP requests to the specified DHCP server IP address.
36,,6,What are common issues encountered with DHCP and how can they be troubleshooted?,Common DHCP issues include address pool exhaustion misconfigurations and network connectivity problems.

Responses can be: **Authoritative** **Non-authoritative** or **Referral**.
41,,7,Explain the process of resolving a DNS query.,The DNS query process involves: 1. The client sends a query to a local DNS resolver. 2. The resolver checks its cache. 3. If not cached the resolver queries a root DNS server. 4. The root server responds with a referral to a TLD server. 5. The resolver queries the TLD server which responds with a referral to an authoritative server. 6. The resolver queries the authoritative server which responds with the requested IP address. 7. The resolver caches the result and returns it to the client.

46,,8,What tools can be used to troubleshoot DNS issues and how are they used?,Common DNS troubleshooting tools include: 1. **dig**: Queries DNS servers and displays the responses. Example: `dig example.com`. 2. **nslookup**: Queries DNS servers. Example: `nslookup example.com`. 3. **host**: A simple utility to perform DNS lookups. Example: `host example.com`. These tools help diagnose issues like DNS resolution failures incorrect DNS records and network connectivity problems.
47,,8,How can you verify DNS propagation for a new or updated DNS record?,To verify DNS propagation: 1. Use `dig` to query different DNS servers. Example: `dig @8.8.8.8 example.com`. 2. Use online tools like WhatsMyDNS.net to check DNS records from multiple locations worldwide. This helps ensure that the new or updated DNS records have been distributed across the global DNS infrastructure.
48,,9,What is the primary purpose of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?,TCP is a connection-oriented protocol used for reliable communication between network devices. It ensures that data is delivered in the same order it was sent without duplication or loss by establishing a connection through a three-way handshake and maintaining it with sequence numbers and acknowledgments.
49,,9,Describe the TCP three-way handshake process.,The TCP three-way handshake is used to establish a reliable connection between a client and server: 1. **SYN**: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate a connection. 2. **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet to acknowledge the client's request. 3. **ACK**: The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server completing the handshake and establishing a connection.
50,,9,What is TCP segmentation and why is it important?,TCP segmentation divides large data messages into smaller segments for transmission. This is important because it allows data to be sent over networks with varying maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes ensuring efficient and reliable communication.
51,,9,How does TCP handle reassembly of segmented data?,TCP uses sequence numbers to keep track of each segment's position in the original data stream. The receiver uses these sequence numbers to reassemble the segments in the correct order ensuring that the data is complete and properly sequenced.
52,,9,What is the purpose of TCP flow control?,TCP flow control prevents network congestion and ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver with too much data at once. It uses a sliding window mechanism to manage the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver.
53,,10,Explain the sliding window mechanism in TCP.,The sliding window mechanism in TCP allows the sender to send multiple segments before needing an acknowledgment for the first segment. The size of the window determines the amount of unacknowledged data that can be in transit. The receiver advertises the window size and the sender adjusts its transmission rate accordingly.
54,,10,What are the key algorithms used in TCP congestion control?,The key algorithms used in TCP congestion control include: 1. **Slow Start**: Begins with a small congestion window and increases it exponentially until packet loss occurs. 2. **Congestion Avoidance**: Increases the congestion window linearly to avoid congestion. 3. **Fast Retransmit**: Detects packet loss through duplicate acknowledgments and retransmits lost packets quickly. 4. **Fast Recovery**: Temporarily reduces the congestion window and then increases it linearly to recover from packet loss.
55,,10,Describe the Slow Start algorithm in TCP.,The Slow Start algorithm starts with a small congestion window size (usually one segment) and increases it exponentially with each acknowledgment received doubling the window size each round-trip time (RTT) until a threshold is reached or packet loss occurs.
56,,10,How does TCP perform error detection?,TCP performs error detection using checksums. Each TCP segment includes a checksum field that the sender calculates based on the segment's header and data. The receiver recalculates the checksum and compares it to the value in the received segment. If they match the segment is considered error-free; otherwise it is discarded.
57,,10,What mechanisms does TCP use for error recovery?,TCP uses acknowledgment (ACK) packets and retransmissions for error recovery. If the sender does not receive an ACK for a segment within a certain time (timeout) it assumes the segment was lost and retransmits it. Additionally TCP employs fast retransmit and recovery mechanisms to quickly address packet loss detected through duplicate ACKs.
58,,11,What is the purpose of TCP window scaling?,TCP window scaling is used to support larger window sizes than the default maximum of 65535 bytes. It is important for high-speed long-distance networks where larger window sizes can improve throughput. The window scaling option is negotiated during the three-way handshake.
59,,11,How does TCP selective acknowledgment (SACK) improve performance?,TCP selective acknowledgment (SACK) allows the receiver to inform the sender about all the segments that have been received successfully rather than just the next expected segment. This enables the sender to retransmit only the missing segments improving performance and efficiency.
60,,11,How can you enable and configure TCP keepalive on a Linux system?,To enable and configure TCP keepalive on a Linux system you can use the following sysctl commands: `sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=300` `sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=75` `sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=9`. These commands set the keepalive time interval and number of probes respectively.
