1;;56;What five key functions do operating systems provide?;1. An application platform - A place for programs to run.<br /><br />2. Hardware moderator - An communication interface to the hardware it is installed on. <br /><br />3. Data storage - The operating system manages the access to storage devices.<br /><br />4. Security.<br /><br />5. Connectivity - The operating system manages connectivity using a variety of network media. 
2;;56;The Linux operating system is composed of what following components?;1. The Linux kernel - The kernel is the actual operating system that performs key operating system duties.<br /><br />2. Libraries - Libraries are prewritten code elements that can be used by application programers for programs. They reduce the amount of code writing needed to access things in the system.<br /><br />3. Utilities - These utilities are used to help with managing system task.<br /><br />4. User interface - This user interface can be the command line or a graphical user interface. 
3;;56;Who developed the Minix clone of Unix?;Andrew S. Tanebaum<br /><br />The source code to Minix was included in his textbook &quot Operating Systems: Design and Implementation&quot  (Prentice Hall, 1987).
4;;56;What year was the developemment of Linus Torvald clone of Unix started?;October 5, 1991<br><br>It had three utilities:<br><br>-- Bash<br><br>-- Update, A utility for flushing file system buffers.<br><br>-- gcc, A C++ compiler
5;;56;In what year was Linux version 1.0 released?;1994
6;;56;In what year did Richard Stallman launch the GNU project?;1983
7;;56;What are the names of some popular Linux distributions?;-- openSUSE Linux<br><br>-- Ubuntu Linux<br><br>-- Fedora Linux<br><br>-- Red Hat Enterprise Linux<br><br>-- Debian Linux<br><br>-- Mandriva Linux<br><br>-- Gentoo Linux<br><br>-- Slackware Linux<br><br>-- CentOS
8;;56;What are the most common Linux roles?;-- Desktop<br><br>-- Server<br><br>-- Firewall
9;;41;What system is used to provide a desktop GUI interface?;The X Window System is used with desktop environments like GNOME or KDE to provide a graphical interface.
10;;57;What is a 'shell'?;A shell is a command interpreter that allows you to type commands at the keyboard that are sent to the operating system kernel. 
11;;57;What are some popular command shells for Linux?;sh (Bourne Shell) - This was an early shell deveopled for UNIX. <br /><br />bash (Bourne-Again Shell) - This shell is an improved shell from 'sh'. It tends to be installed by default on most Linux distributions.<br /><br />csh (C Shell) - The csh shell was originally developed for BSD UNIX.It uses a syntax that is very similar to C programming.<br /><br />tsch - The tsch shell is an improved version of the C Shell. It is the default shell used on FreeBSD systems. <br /><br />zsh (Z Shell) - The Z Shell is an improved version of the bash shell. 
12;;57;How can you use the 'echo' command to view your running shell?;echo $SHELL
13;;57;In the Linux GUI what key combinations can you use to bring up a shell prompt?;CTRL-ALT-Fx <br /><br />The x is a number from 1 to 6. <br /><br />Make the x into a 7 to return to the GUI.<br><br>** NOTE: In Fedora systems you press ALT-F1 to return to your GUI environment. 
14;;57;In a shell log in how can you bring up another shell?;ALT-Fx<br><br>Where x is a number from 2 to 6 to open a new session.<br><br>To switch back make enter 1 in the x place holder. 
15;;60;What is opened when you boot the system to runlevel 3?;A login shell is opened when you boot to runlevel 3.<br><br>If you boot into a graphical enviroment (runlevel 5) a login shell is still created at boot, but it is not seen. 
16;;60;When are you opening a non-login shell?;When you boot to the desktop GUI and bring up the terminal you are in a non-login shell.<br><br>When using a non-login shellbash runs /etc/bashrc for system wide functions and aliases, and then it runs ~/.bashrc from the user's home directory for user-specific customizations. 
17;;60;When a login shell is run what order does the bash shell search for configuration files?;The /etc/profile is read first to intially configure the shell environment. The shell then searches for the following files in the user's home directory in the following order:<br><br>1. ~/.bash_profile<br /><br />2. ~/.bash_login<br /><br />3. ~/.profile
18;;60;For changing the bash shell environment for all users what file is recommended to be edited instead of the /etc/profile file?;/etc/profile.local<br /><br />This helps to avoid changes which might happen when an update is applied to the operating system. 
19;;60;What are some bash configuration files?;/etc/bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc -- Non-login shells -- contains shell system wide functions and aliases.<br /><br />~/.bashrc -- Non-login shells (some login shells from certain ditributions use this called from the configuration files listed below) -- Stores user-specific functions and aliases. <br /><br />/etc/profile and the files in /etc/profile.d -- Login shells -- Contains system-wide shell environment configuration parameters.<br /><br />~/.bash_profile -- Login shells -- Stores user-specific shell preferences.<br /><br />~/.bash_login -- Login shells -- Stores user-specific shell preferences.<br /><br />~/.profile -- Login shells -- Stores user-specific shell preferences.<br /><br />~/.bash_logout -- Loging shells -- Stores user-specific shell preferences.
20;;61;What file is used when you log out of the bash shell?;.bash_logout<br /><br />Most distributions don't include this file in user's home directories by default. However most systems will allow the user to create their own .bash_logout file. 
21;;61;What location by default is not checked by the PATH enviromental variable by the command interpreter?;It does not check the current directory. Linux only searches for the file being run within the directories in the current user's PATH variable. <br /><br />Typically this is something like this:<br /><br />$ echo $PATH<br />/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games<br><br>The command 'env' also lists the PATH variable as part of its output.<br /><br />
22;;61;What are the ways around running a executable not stored in a location in the PATH variable?;1. Enter the full path to th file:<br><br>/home/some_folder/runme.sh<br><br>2. Switch to the directory where this resides and run with './' added like this:<br><br>./runme.sh<br><br>3. You can add the directory where executable is to the PATH variable.
23;;61;What command can be used when running a command from the shell that replaces the shell with the process in the command?;exec<br><br>Usually commands when executed run alongside the shell process. Using 'exec' you replace the shell with the process (exit).
24;;61;In what file is the command history kept?;~/.bash_history<br /><br />You can display the contents of the file by entering 'history' in the shell prompt.<br /><br />You can search through history entering part of the command and the CTRL-R.
25;;61;What are some variables for managing the history file used for bash?;HISTSIZE or HISTFILESIZE<br><br>This controls the size of the history file. Most distributions set this at 1000 entries. <br><br>HISTCONTROL<br><br>This controlls how your command history is stored. <br><br>-- ignorespace, Ignore commands that start with a space. <br><br>-- ignoredups, Ignore duplicate commands. <br><br>-- ignoreboth, This combines ignorespace and ignoredups.<br><br>-- erasedups, Removes all duplicate entries. 
26;;9;What are the main sources of documentation for Linux?;The 'man' and 'info' pages available through the command line. 
27;;9;What are some ways to show the man page path depending on the distribution?;1. echo $MANPATH<br /><br />2. 'manpath -g' or 'manpath -a'<br><br>3. MANPATH_MAP directive in the /etc/man_db.conf file to specify the directories where man pages are stored.

35;;10;What section in the man manual list documentation on administrative utilities used by the root user?;man8
36;;10;What section in the man manual list documentation on kernel routing documentation?;man9
37;;11;What types of heading listings are usually included in the man output.;-- Title, The title lists the name of the utitily, command or file followed by the section number. <br><br>-- Name, The NAME section simply displays the name of the command, file, or utility and a short abstract about what it does. <br><br>-- Synopsis, The SYNOPSIS section provides a brief description of the syntax for using a particular command or utility. If the man page documents a configuration file the SYNOPSIS section provides a brief overview of what the file is used for.<br><br>-- Description, The DESCRIPTION section describes how the command, file, or utilty works in detail. This is the section where all the options are listed. <br><br>-- AUTHOR<br><br>-- REPORTING BUGS, email address for reporting bugs.<br><br>-- COPYRIGHT, copyright and redistribution information. <br><br>-- SEE ALSO, Provides a list of other man pages or other resources that are related. <br><br>-- Version Number and Revision Date.<br><br>-- Other optional entires like OPTIONS, FILES, ENVIRONMENT, or DIAGNOSTICS. 
38;;11;How do you search for a term in the man page?;/&lt word&gt <br><br>Enter the word afterthe forward slash. To see the next instance of this word in the page enter 'n'. <br><br>
39;;11;What are two different ways to search across man pages for terms?;1. man -k<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />man -k remove<br /><br />2. apropos <br /><br />Example:<br /><br />apropos remove
40;;11;In the info output what are pages called?;nodes
41;;11;What is the advantage of using the info pages instead of the man pages?;Info pages tend to be more descriptive of the process of using the command. The man page only lists the command and its syntax.
42;;11;What are some shortcut movements in the info node?;Down Arrow, Scrolls down one line at a time. <br /><br />Up Arrow, Scrolls up one line at a time. <br /><br />Page Down, Scrolls down one page at a time. <br /><br />Page Up, Scrolls up one page at a time. <br /><br />DEL or Backspace, Scrolls up one page at a time. <br /><br />Home, Moves you to the beginning of the node. <br /><br />End, moves you to the end of the node. <br /><br />N, Takes you to the next node. <br /><br />Q, Unloads the current man page and exits the info ulitilty. 
43;;11;How do you bring up search in an info node?;CTRL-S<br><br>To get to the next instance of the search text press CTRL-S again. 
44;;62;What environmental variable defines the full path to the shell executable?;BASH or SHELL<br><br>The default value is usually /bin/bash
45;;62;What environmental variable lists the type of CPU installed in the system?;CPU<br><br>The default value depends on your system. 
46;;62;What environmental variable displays the location of where the X Window display should be sent?;DISPLAY<br><br>0.0 (the local video card and monitor)
47;;62;What environmental variable displays the name of the file bash reads to configure its environment?;ENV<br><br>It has a default value of /bash/bash.bashrc.
48;;62;What environmental variable lists the user ID (UID) of the current user?;EUID

53;;63;What environmental variable lists the username of the current user?;LOGNAME<br><br>
54;;63;What environmental variable lists the&nbsp &nbsp path to the current user's mailbox file?;MAIL<br><br>The default location is /var/spool/mail/username or /var/mail/username
55;;63;What environmental variable lists the psth to the prior current directory?;OLDPWD
56;;64;What environmental variable has a list of directories to be searched when running a command from the shell prompt?;PATH
57;;64;What environmental variable outputs the path to the current working directory?;PWD
58;;64;What command will show a scrollable list of all environmental variables from the shell?;set | less<br><br>or<br><br>env | less
59;;64;What is the technique to temporarily modify or add a shell variable?;In the shell enter variable=value. <br><br>For example<br><br>PATH=$PATH:/var/opt/my_folder<br><br>If you do not include the $PATH after the equals the variable is replaced with the value instead of appended.<br><br>This PATH variable now only applies to the current shell. To make the assignment to apply to all shells, you need to export the new value of the variable. <br><br>export variable 
60;;64;What is a typical PS1 display shell prompt settings for a user in Cent OS?;[\u@\h \W]\$<br><br>The values here are:<br><br>\u&nbsp &nbsp the username of the current user<br><br>\h&nbsp &nbsp the hostname up to the first '.'<br><br>\W&nbsp &nbsp the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde<br>
61;;64;Where can you find information on changing the PS1 prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded?;First in the shell<br /><br />man bash<br /><br />Then go to the prompting section. <br /><br />Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded.<br /><br />Some examples are:<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \d&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp date&nbsp &nbsp in &quot Weekday Month Date&quot  format (e.g., &quot Tue May 26&quot )<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \h&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the hostname up to the first `.'<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \H&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the hostname<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \t&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \T&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \w&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the current working&nbsp &nbsp directory,&nbsp &nbsp with&nbsp &nbsp $HOME&nbsp &nbsp abbreviated<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp with&nbsp &nbsp a tilde (uses the value of the PROMPT_DIRTRIM vari‐<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp able)<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \W&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp abbreviated with a tilde<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \[&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp begin&nbsp &nbsp a sequence of non-printing characters, which could<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp be used to embed a terminal&nbsp &nbsp control&nbsp &nbsp sequence&nbsp &nbsp into&nbsp &nbsp the<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp prompt<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp end a sequence of non-printing characters<br />
62;;64;What are some limits on user defined variables?;-- Variable names can contain letters or numbers, but they may not begin with a number.<br><br>-- Variable names may contain hyphens (-) or underscore characters (_).<br><br>-- Try to use all uppercase characters.
63;;65;What is an alias in the shell?;Aliases allows a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.&nbsp &nbsp The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the alias and unalias builtin commands.<br /><br />The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word&nbsp &nbsp that is&nbsp &nbsp identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias ls to ls -F, for instance, and bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.
64;;65;How do you assign a command to an alias?;alias name=&quot command&quot <br><br>You can create an alias with multiple commands by seperating them with a semicolon ( ). <br><br>You can make an alias persistent by adding to the bash configuration files that are either system-wide of user-specific. 
65;;65;What are the standard three bash shell file descriptors?;stdin - Standard input  The stdin for a command is represented by the number 0. <br /><br />stdout - Standard ouput  The stdout for a command is represented by the number 1. <br /><br />stderr - Standard error  The stderr for a command is represented by the number 2.&nbsp &nbsp 
66;;65;What is the syntax for redirection to a file the command shell? ;command output&gt  filename_or_device<br /><br />If you do not enter the file descriptor number in the command (output), the shell will assume the you want to redirect only stdout from the command.<br /><br />If you would like to append to an existing file instead of replacing it use &gt &gt  instead of &gt .
67;;65;What is the syntax for redirecting input in the shell?;command &lt  input_text_or_file<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />sort &lt  My_list
68;;65;What is the advantage of using the 'tee' command. ;The 'tee' command writes to standard out and to a file.<br /><br />Syntax:<br /><br />command | tee filename
69;;65;What command can be used to remove a value assigned to a variable?;unset<br><br>Syntax:<br><br>unset variable_name<br><br>For debian based the command is unsetenv. <br><br>This is a builtinbash command.<br><br>
70;;12;What is the most common folder to store system configuration files in?;/etc
71;;12;What are VI'S four different operating modes? <br /><br />;1. Command mode (normal mode)<br /><br />This mode is used for different commands to delete copy, search and manipulate the file.<br /><br />2. Command-line mode <br /><br />This mode is entered after command mode by entering a colon (:). This mode is for file related tasks.<br /><br />3. Insert mode<br /><br />This mode is where text is typed. There are no file operations in this mode. The Esc key gets out of this mode. <br /><br />4. Replace mode<br /><br />Pressing INSERT twice will get you in this mode. This mode overwrites the current location of the cursor. 
72;;12;What are some different ways of enter insert mode in VI.;i, Insert key, s, o, a<br /><br />
73;;12;What are some common commands at the command-line fo VI?;exit<br /><br />Writes the current file and then closes vi.<br /><br />wq <br /><br />Also writes the current file to disk and closes vi.<br /><br />q<br /><br />Closes viwithout saving the current file. This can be used only if the file hasn't changed. If the file has been changed, then you must enter q!<br /><br />w!<br /><br />Overwrites the current file<br /><br />e!<br /><br />Forget changes since last write.
74;;12;What feature in vi can help check for syntax issue?;In the command mode enter<br><br>:syntax on | off
75;;12;What are the equivalent of the arrow keys in the vi command mode?;h - Moves the cursor left one character<br /><br />j - Moves the cursor down one line.<br /><br />k - Moves the cursor up one line.<br /><br />l - Moves the cursor right one character.<br><br>o - Moves the cursor to the start of the current line. 
76;;13;Name some command options in VI for saving text and/or leaving VI.;:w Write<br /><br />:wq Write quit<br /><br />:x Write and quit<br /><br />:q Quit<br /><br />:q! Quit and ignore changes<br /><br />ZZ Write if change and quit (notice there is no colon).<br /><br />:r filename Read in file name<br /><br />: w filename Write to filename<br /><br />:n,m w filename Write lines n through m to filename<br /><br />:e! Forget change<br /><br />:w! Overwirtes the current file<br /><br />:exit Writes the current file and then closes VI<br />
77;;13;In command mode what are some of the delete options for VI?;Each of these take the text deleted and saves in a temporary memory buffer. <br><br>x - Delete the character.<br><br>D - Delete the rest of the line.<br /><br />dw - Deletes the word that come immediately after the cursor, including the space following the word. <br /><br />de - Deletes the word that comes immediately after the cursor, not including the space. <br /><br />d$ - Deletes from the insertion point to the end of the line. <br /><br />dd - Deletes the entire current line. <br /><br />If you would like to use the memory buffer use the command below. <br /><br />p - Inserts the text deleted in the last deletion operation after the current cursor location. 
78;;13;What can be used in command mode in VI to undo the last action?;u Undo the last change.<br><br>U Undo all changes on the same line.<br>
79;;13;What are some append options in the command mode in VI?;a Append after cursor.<br><br>A Append after line.
80;;13;What are some copy options in command mode in VI?;yy Yank the line in which the cursor is located to the buffer. <br><br>yw Yank the word to the buffer.<br><br><br><br><br>
81;;13;In VI command mode how can you get the status of the current file?;CTRL-G<br><br>This diaplays a status line at the bottom of the interface. The contents include name of the file, the status of the file, the total number of lines, and the current cursor location. <br><br>
82;;14;What are some change commands in command mode for VI?;C Change to the end of the line.<br /><br />cw Change the current word with new text, starting with the character under the cursor, until ESC is hit. <br /><br />cc Change the whole line. <br /><br />c (c followed by a space) Change the character.<br><br>c) Change the rest of the sentence from the cursor. 
83;;14;What are some different methods of searching in the VI editor?;In the command mode run these commands.<br /><br />-- Search forward in the text.<br /><br />/search_term<br /><br />-- Search backwards in the text<br /><br />?search_term<br /><br />-- Repeat the last search given by &quot /&quot  or &quot ?&quot <br /><br />n<br><br /><br>-- Replace all occurances of pattern on the current line<br />with replacement.<br /><br />:s/pattern/replacement/ <br /><br />-- Replace all occurances of pattern in the whole file<br />with replacement.<br /> <br />:s/pattern/replacement/g <br /><br />A search and replace through all lines of a file is common enough that a shorthand command was developed to stand for &quot first through last.&quot  The percent sign (%) is equivalent to the address range 1,$. <br><br /><br>:%s/pattern/replacement/<br><br />The &quot .&quot  and &quot $&quot  play a special role in this sort of designation. &quot .&quot  indicates the current line, and &quot $&quot  indicates the last line of the file. <br><br /><br>To delete from the current line to the end:<br><br /><br>:.,$d<br><br /><br><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
84;;29;What are some common Linux disk file systems?;Fat16, Fat32, NTFS, ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserFS, JFS, XFS, Btrfs
85;;29;What is the top most directory in Linux/Unix?;/<br><br>The root directory.
86;;29;What directory contains the executable files and essential command binaries?;/bin
87;;29;What directory contains the files which are required to boot your system?;/boot
88;;29;What directory contains special files that are used to represent the hardware devices installed on the system?;/dev
89;;29;What are two types of files in use for the /dev directory?;1. Character-oriented device files are used for devices that send or receive data sequentially one character at a time. These devices usually don't support random access to the data they manage. <br><br>Some devices are printers, mouse , and tape drives. <br><br>2. Block-oriented device files are used for devices that manage data in blocks. Block devices usually support random access to the data they manage.<br><br>Some devices are floppy disks and hard drives.
90;;29;What directory contain files that are use to represt the various hardawr device installed on the system?;/dev
91;;29;What are the common Linux device names?;-- The first floppy drive is named /dev/fd0.<br><br>-- The second floppy drive is named /dev/fd1.<br><br>-- The first SCSI disk (SCSI ID address-wise) is named /dev/sda.<br><br>-- The second SCSI disk (address-wise) is named /dev/sdb, and so on.<br><br>-- The first SCSI CD-ROM is named /dev/scd0, also known as /dev/sr0.<br><br>-- The master disk on IDE primary controller is named /dev/hda.<br><br>Here is a real-life example. Let's assume you have a system with 2 SCSI disks, one at SCSI address 2 and the other at SCSI address 4. The first disk (at address 2) is then named sda, and the second sdb. If the sda drive has 3 partitions on it, these will be named sda1, sda2, and sda3. The same applies to the sdb disk and its partitions.<br><br>Note that if you have two SCSI host bus adapters (i.e., controllers), the order of the drives can get confusing. The best solution in this case is to watch the boot messages, assuming you know the drive models and/or capacities.<br><br>Linux represents the primary partitions as the drive name, plus the numbers 1 through 4. For example, the first primary partition on the first IDE drive is /dev/hda1. The logical partitions are numbered starting at 5, so the first logical partition on that same drive is /dev/hda5. Remember that the extended partition, that is, the primary partition holding the logical partitions, is not usable by itself. This applies to SCSI disks as well as IDE disks. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The slave disk on IDE primary controller is named /dev/hdb.<br><br>The master and slave disks of the secondary controller can be called /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd, respectively. Newer IDE controllers can actually have two channels, effectively acting like two controllers.<br><br>The partitions on each disk are represented by appending a decimal number to the disk name: sda1 and sda2 represent the first and second partitions of the first SCSI disk drive in your system. 
92;;33;What directory can optionally be used to access system resources that have no connection to physical hardware?;/dev<br /><br />An example could be a random number generator.<br /><br />/dev/random
93;;33;What directory contains text-based configuration files used to control the operation of a program?;/etc<br><br>These files can not an executable binary.

This helps to prevent is from being overwritten during a system update.<br><br>sbin - System administration programs. <br><br>share - Documentation and man page files.
121;;36;What directory contains variable data files?;/var<br><br>This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files. Some portions of /var are not shareable between different systems. For instance, /var/log, /var/lock, and /var/run. Other portions may be shared, notably /var/mail, /var/cache/man, /var/cache/fonts, and /var/spool/news.<br><br>Some subdirectories are:<br><br>lib - Library files created by various services and applications running on the system.<br><br>log - Log files from your system and from services running on the system.<br><br>spool - Print queues.<br><br>
122;;36;What are the common Linux file types? ;Regular file -- These files are similar to other OS types: executable files, text, image, etc...<br><br>Links -- These files are pointers that point to other files in the file system.<br><br>FIFOs -- These are special files used to move data from one running process on the system to another. A FIFO files is basically a queue where the first chunk of data added to the queue is the first chunk of data removed from the queue. Data can only move in one direction through a FIFO.<br><br>Sockets -- Sockets are like FIFOs, but can move data bi-directionally.
123;;36;What is the basic syntax for the find command?;find /path -name &quot filename&quot <br /><br />You can use regular expressions:<br /><br />find /path -name &quot *.log&quot <br /><br />By default the find command does not follow symbolic links. The -L option allows for the following of symbolic links. <br /><br />You can also use find to search for<br /><br />find -size 100k&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (file size)<br /><br />find -empty -type -f&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (empty files)<br /><br />find -nouser&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (find no user)<br /><br />find -user root&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (find root files)<br /><br />find -type f -perm -110&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (files permissions)<br /><br />find ~ -mtime -5 -name \.\*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (find hidden files in the last five days)
124;;36;What command can you use to show the full path to a command?;which &lt command&gt 
125;;36;What two options could you use to show the location of the binaries?;1. which<br /><br />2. whereis -b
126;;36;What command can you use to show the location of a commands manual page?;whereis -m &lt command&gt 
127;;36;What are the differences between locate, find, and whereis commands?;whereis: will search only particular paths to find binaries and or manpages. The manpages tells you where whereis looks.<br><br>locate: locate uses a database created by an updatedb to efficiently locate files. Works great, assuming your database is updated often enough to be reasonable upto date. Most boxes using locate have the updatedb occuring in cron.<br><br>find: find is perhaps one of the most powerful commands there is. For just locating a file/program of a particular name, it'll definitely be slower than locate or whereis becuase it will search each and every path recursively from it's start point.
128;;36;What command can you use to indicate how a name would be interpreted if used as a command name?;type<br /><br />The values returned will be one of the following.<br /><br />1. A command that is hard coded into the shell itself.<br /><br />2. An external command that is called by the shell. <br><br />3. An alias. <br /><br />4. A function. <br><br />If a command has been run recently in the shell, the output of type says that the command is stored in the shell's hash table.<br /><br />Enter type -a will return all instances of the specified command in the file system. The bash shell allows you to create new internal commands by defining your own shell functions. 
129;;37;What command displays your current working directory?;pwd
130;;37;What character stands for the current user's home directory?;~<br><br>tidle
131;;37;What option for the command pwd displays the physical directory without symbolic links?;pwd -P
132;;37;What command is based around relative paths and absolute paths? ;cd<br><br>Relative paths work off the point you are in the file system.<br><br>Absolute paths specify the full path, starting from /.<br><br>The command cd entered by itself will move you to the home directory of the currently logged-in user.
133;;37;What options with cd allow for moving up and down directory trees?;cd ..<br><br>Change back a directory.<br><br>cd ../..<br><br>Change back two directories. <br><br><br><br>

138;;38;What command is used to create a directory?;mkdir<br><br>The command can use the relative or absolute path for this command. <br><br>On many distributions, an alias named md is defined by one of the shell configuration files that runs the mkdir -p command.
139;;38;What are some link options for the cp command?;`-d'<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp files that they point to, and preserve hard links between source<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp files in the copies.&nbsp &nbsp Equivalent to `--no-dereference<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp --preserve=links'.<br /><br />`-l'<br />`--link'<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Make hard links instead of copies of non-directories.<br /><br />`-L'<br />`--dereference'<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Follow symbolic links when copying from them.&nbsp &nbsp With this option,<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp `cp' cannot create a symbolic link.&nbsp &nbsp For example, a symlink (to<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp regular file) in the source tree will be copied to a regular file<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in the destination tree.<br />
140;;38;What command option for cp copies all directories recursively? ;-R<br><br>example cp -R ~/MyFiles ~/backup
141;;38;What command is like cp but will delete the orginal file after moving?;mv<br /><br />The mv command can also be used to rename directories or files. <br /><br />
142;;38;What option with the cp command tries to preserve attributes? ;`-a'<br />`--archive'<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Preserve as much as possible of the structure and attributes of the<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp original files in the copy (but do not attempt to preserve internal<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp directory structure  i.e., `ls -U' may list the entries in a copied<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp directory in a different order).&nbsp &nbsp Try to preserve SELinux security<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp context and extended attributes (xattr), but ignore any failure to<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp do that and print no corresponding diagnostic.&nbsp &nbsp Equivalent to `-dR<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp --preserve=all' with the reduced diagnostics.<br />
143;;38;What command is used to delete an existing directory?;rmdir<br /><br>The directory must be empty.<br><br />On some distributions there is an alias, rd, that runs the rmdir command. <br /><br />The command rm can also be used. <br /><br />
144;;38;What command should you use instead of rm if you want to make sure a file is not recoverable?;shred
145;;38;What command has the ability to remove folders recursively?;rm -r /directory
146;;38;What option can you add to the rm command to be prompted to acknowledge the deletion?;If the `-I' or `--interactive=once' option is given, and there are<br />more than three files or the `-r', `-R', or `--recursive' are given,<br />then `rm' prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire<br />operation.&nbsp &nbsp If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is<br />aborted.<br />
147;;39;What command can you use to create a file of 0 bytes?;touch
148;;39;What are the common commands for viewing files?;cat -- This shows the full file at once. <br /><br />head -- Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name. Often times the count option (-n) is given to change the number of lines.<br /><br />tail -- Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name. Often times the count option (-n) is given to change the number of lines or -f will monitor the file for additional last lines.<br /><br />less -- The less command is like cat but will pause when the screen is full. You can use the SPACEBAR, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN and ARROW keys to navigate around the ouput. <br /><br />more - The more command is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
149;;39;What is a common command to monitor new content which is added to the end of a file? ;tail -f<br><br>Example:<br><br>tail -f /var/log/messages<br><br>This command will follow the input of the file. 
150;;39;What is the command to remove files or directories?;rm
151;;39;What option can you use with rm to remove directories and files recursively?;-r, -R, --recursive<br><br>remove directories and their contents recursively<br>
152;;39;What command will print the file's type?;file<br><br>The command file works by comparing the file to file signatures in /usr/share/misc/magic, usr/share/misc/magic.mgc and /etc/magic.<br><br>
153;;39;What are the differences between the two types of links in Linux?;Hard Link<br><br>A hard link is a file that points directly to the inode of another file. Because the two files use the same inode, you can't tell which file is the pointer and which is the destination. <br><br>Symbolic Link<br><br>Symbolic links have their own inode. This makes the pointer and the destination easy to differentiate. <br> 
154;;40;What is an inode, what is the typical way to list them, and what does it contain?;An inode is a storage place for data on a file or folder. One of the most common ways to lists this information is the ls command with the -i option. <br /><br />ls -i<br /><br />Typically the attribute information is:<br /><br />The size of the file in bytes<br /><br />Device ID<br /><br />User ID of the file<br /><br />Group ID of the file<br /><br />The file mode that determines the file type and how the owner, group, and others (world) can access the file.<br /><br />Additional system and user flags to further protect the file.<br /><br />Timestamps telling when the inode itself was last change (ctime, changing time), the file content was last modified (mtime or modification time), and when the file was last accessed (atime or access time).<br /><br />A link counter that lists how many hard links point to the inode.<br /><br />Pointers to the disk blocks that store the file’s contents. <br /><br />
155;;40;What is the syntax for creating a link file?;The command is ln. The syntax is:<br><br>ln pointee_file pointer_file<br><br>If it is run without any options a hard link is made. To create a symbolic link use the -s option. <br><br>
156;;40;Name two command options for listing a link file;file &lt filename&gt <br><br>ls -l
157;;40;What command option can you use with grep to search recursively through subdirectories?;grep -r
158;;40;What command option can you use with grep to show all lines that do not contain the search string?;grep -v
159;;40;What command option for grep will display the line numbers along with the search results?;grep -n
160;;30;What command option with grep can be used to ignore case when searching?;grep -i
161;;30;What is the difference between the commands egrep and grep?;The command egrep is an acronym for &quot Extended Global Regular Expressions Print&quot . It is a program which scans a specified file line by line, returning lines that contain a pattern matching a given regular expression. The search string must be a regular expression.<br /><br />The command grep uses standard input and can not contain regular expressions. Running grep -E is essentially the same as egrep.<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -E, --extended-regexp<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression <br />
162;;30;What do regular expressions consist of?;Regular expression are strings of metacharacters and literals. <br /><br />Literals are regular characters: A-Z, a-z and numerals<br /><br />Metacharacter are characters that do not represent themselves but instead represent other characters. <br /><br />See the regex(7) man page for more information.
163;;30;What are some common regular expressions used with commands like egrep?;* Matches any number of any characters.<br /><br />. Matches a single character.<br /><br />^ Matches an expression if it appears at the beginning of a line. <br /><br />$ Matches an expression if it appears at the end of a line. <br /><br />| Matches an expression on either side of the pipe character. <br /><br />[nnn] Matches any one character between the braces. <br /><br />[^nnn} Matches an expression that does not contain any one of the characters specified. <br /><br />[n-n] Mathes any single character in the range. 
164;;30;The command grep -F is the same as what command? ;fgrep<br><br>The fgrep command differs from the grep and egrep commands because it searches for a string instead of searching for a pattern that matches an expression. The fgrep command uses a fast and compact algorithm. The $, *, [, |, (, ) and \ characters are interpreted literally by the fgrep command. These characters are not interpreted as parts of a regular expression, as they would be in the grep and egrep command. Since these characters have special meaning to the shell, the entire string should be enclosed in single quotes ('...'). 
165;;30;What is the configuraton file used to keep the locate command up to date?;/etc/updatedb.conf<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp updatedb creates or updates a database used by locate(1). If the<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp database already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp directories that have not changed.<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp updatedb is usually run daily by cron(8)to update the default<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp database.<br /><br />You can set the PRUNFS variable in this file to the file system type(s) you don't want updatedb to scan. You can also set the PRUNEPATHS variable in the file to a list of directories in your file system you want updatedb to skip when scanning.
166;;30;What is the Linux file system based on?;Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
167;;52;What should you check before purchasing hardware for your Linux installation?;Check the hardware compatibility list (HCL) on the distributions web site.<br><br>Then verify the system requirements. 
168;;52;What are the most widely used file system types for Linux?;ext2<br><br>ext3<br><br>Reiser<br><br>ext4
169;;52;What does the acronym ext2 stand for?;Second Extended File System<br><br>-- Introduced in 1993.<br><br>-- Stores data in a hierarchical fashion.<br><br>-- Maximum files size is 2 terabytes. <br><br>-- The maximum volume is 4 terabytes.<br><br>-- File names have a limit of 255 characters. <br><br>-- Support users, groups and permissions (POSIX permissions). <br><br>-- Supports file compression. <br><br>-- It takes a long time to recover if the system shuts down abruptly. Upon system halts the operating system first cleanly dismounts the file system. When this happens it is possible that pending disk transactions weren't completed. The ext2 file system will run a program called e2fsck that tries to fix any problems. If nonallocated files or unclaimed blocks of data are found it will write this information in a directory called lost+found. The could take hours on larger systems.&nbsp &nbsp <br>
170;;52;What does the acronym ext3 stand for?;Third Extended File System<br><br>It is backwards compatilbe with ext2.<br /><br />The ext3 file system has one big advantage over the ext2 file system. It runs journaling. Before committing a transaction to the hard disk drive, the ext3 file system records the transaction to a journal and marks it as incomplete. After the disk transaction is complete, the ext3 file system marks the transaction as complete in the journal. This means that after a improper shutdown the journal can be replayed to verify the disk. <br /><br />The disadvantage of ext3 is the journaling process uses up more system memory and slows down disk I/O operations slightly.&nbsp &nbsp 
171;;52;What are some of the differences between the ext3 file system and the Reiser file system?;For Reiser:<br><br /><br>-- It uses a different internal structure allowing file system support for a larger maximum file size of 8 TB and a maximum volume size of 16TB. <br /><br />-- It still has journaling.<br /><br />-- It is faster than ext2 and ext3.
172;;52;What does the acronym ext4 stand for?;Fourth Extended File System<br><br>-- Released late 2008<br><br>-- Backwards compatible with ext2 and ext3. <br><br>-- Supports files up to 16 terabyte and volumes up to 1 exabyte. <br><br>-- A maximum of 4 billion files.<br><br>-- It uses a checksum to verify the journal file itself. <br><br>
173;;52;What is the general recommendation for creating the size of the swap partition?<br>;For desktop systems make the swap partition that is twice the size of the system RAM. <br><br>For server systems use a swap partition the same size as your RAM. <br><br>It is also possible in a Linux system to use a swap file instead of a swap partition. 
174;;52;What are the two required partitions for a Linux installation?;swap <br><br>/ (root)
175;;52;When planning a Linux installation what directories are commonly put on seperate partitions?;/ The root partition should be at least 4GB in size. It may need to be larger to accomodate software updates. <br><br>/boot This partition doesn't usually require more than 100 - 200 MB. <br><br>/home This isolates your users files from other partitions. The amount depends on user's needs. <br><br>/opt This is for application files and space should be modified according to application needs. <br><br>/tmp This is for temporary files and should be at least 1GB.<br><br>/usr The system utilities should have at least 5 GB. Depending on what packages are installed this could be more. <br><br>/ var This partition is for logs. Because log files can become quite large having their own partition adds to stability. At least 3GB should go for this partition. 
176;;53;Where must the /boot partition be placed?;The /boot partition must be created within the first 1024 cylinders of the hard drive disk. 
177;;53;What is a software dependency?;A dependency is a particular software package that another software package needs in order to run. 
178;;53;What are some common methods for an installation source?;--Installing locally from an optical disc or drive. <br><br>-- Installing remotely from a network server.<br><br>-- Completing the remote installation using VNC. 
179;;53;What are common protocols used in network installations?;SMB, NFS, HTTP or FTP.<br><br>Network installation can be useful for a large number of installation.
180;;53;What will you need before installing through the network a distribution?;A basic installation CD which includes a network boot image. 
181;;53;What must you specify in a SMB/CIFS installation?;-- The share and directory where the installation files are located.<br><br>-- The name of the domain. <br><br>-- Username/password of a user who has permissions to access the share. 
182;;53;What must you enter for an installation by FTP?;-- The server IP address of DNS name.<br><br>-- The directory where the installation files reside.<br><br>-- Username/password of an authorized user for the FTP service.
183;;53;What must you enter for an installation through HTTP?;-- The URL of the installation server.<br><br>-- The directory where the installation files reside. 
184;;54;What must you enter in order to install through NFS?;-- The installation server's IP address or DNS name. <br><br>-- The directory on the remote server where the installation files reside.

186;;54;What command can you use to display all the environmental variables for locale settings?;/usr/bin/locale<br>
187;;54;What is the syntax for the LC_CTYPE variable used of establishing locale value?;language_territory.codeset @modifier<br><br>language - Specifies the ISO 639 language code to be used.<br><br>territory - Specifies the ISO 3166 country code to be used. <br><br>codeset - Specifies the charater set to be used. <br><br>modifier - Specifies other locale attributes, such as dialect or currency.
188;;54;What is the precedence order for the LC_ variables for locale settings?;1. If the LC_ALL variable is defined, its value is used and the values assigned to all other LC variables are not checked. <br><br>2. If LC_ALL is undefined, then the specific LC variable in question is checked. If the specific LC variable has a value, it is used.<br><br>3. If the LC variable in question has a null value, the the LANG enviroment variable is used. 
189;;54;What command is used to display locale-specific information?;locale<br /><br />
190;;55;What is the syntax for converting the locale encoding to another?;iconv -f source_encoding -t destination_encoding -o output_filename input_filename
191;;55;What are the two clocks on a Linux system?;Hardware clock - This clock runs independently all the time, even when the system is powered off. The hardware clock is called by a variety of names, including Real Time Clock (RTC) or the BIOS/CMOS clock.<br /><br />This command with the right permissions will output the current hardware clock:<br /><br />hwclock --show<br /><br />System time - This clock runs via software inside the Linux kernel itself. It is driven by an ISA timer interrupt. System time is measured as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC. After booting Linux only uses the system clock after syncing to the hardware clock. <br /><br />
192;;55;When setting your hardware clock which is preferred:<br><br>1. Universal Time Coordinated (UTC often times called Greenwich Mean Time.<br><br>2. Local time.;UTC
193;;55;What are some of the locations the current time zone is stored on different distributions?;/etc/timezone<br /><br />/etc/sysconfig/clock under the TIMEZONE= directive. <br /><br />You can view the current time zone with the date command. <br /><br />In Debian-based distribitions use the tzconfig run as root to change the timezone.<br /><br />In openSUSE/Fedora use the tzselect command. <br /><br />A list of available timezones can be found in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory. <br /><br />To temporarily change the timezone run export TZ=time_zone.
194;;55;What are the commonly used encodings for languages?;-- iso8859, also called Latin-9, which is designed for Western European languages.<br><br>-- ASCII which uses an English-based character-encoding scheme.<br><br>-- Unicode which is designed to handle character sets from languages around the world.
195;;1;On most distributions how can you view the boot messages on a systems displaying a splash screen?;Press the ESC key.
196;;1;How can you view boot logs after boot up?;dmesg | less
197;;1;What are two key roles the BIOS plays during bootup?;1. It test some system components with a power-on self-test (POST).<br /><br />2. It selects the store device that the operating system will boot up from. <br /><br />It looks in the first sector of the device, the boot sector, for the Master Boot Record (MBR).
198;;1;What is the bootloader?;The bootloader is software that the BIOS can load from the MBR of the drive that will allow the CPU to access the drive and load the operating system into RAM. The bootloader is configured with the location of the operating system files on the drive. <br /><br />Sometimes the bootloader is not located in the MBR, but in its place has a pointer. <br /><br />The bootloader may automatically load an operating system or provide a boot menu to users. <br /><br />With later Linux kernels, the bootloader may also create a temporary, virtual file system in your system RAM called a ramdisk. This file system is called initrd image.
199;;1;To load the system OS from a wide variety of devices what might be used?;An initrd image, virtual ramdisk, to use this to transfer a temporary root file system from initrd image to it. The Linux kernel can then use this temporary file system to load the software and complete the task required for it to mount the real file system. 
200;;1;In what directory is the Linux kernel located?;/boot<br><br>The kernel is the vmlinuz-version.gz file located in this directory.
201;;1;What are some of the things the kernel does in the boot process?;1. The kernel uses the various settings in your BIOS/CMOS to intialize the basic hardware.<br /><br />2. The kernel searches for and uses the initrd file system to run the linuxrc program to set up the system. <br /><br />3. When linuxrc has finished executing, the initrd file system is dismounted and the ramdisk is destroyed.<br /><br />4. The kernel probes for new hardware and loads the appropriate driver modules.<br /><br />5. The real root (/) file system is mounted. <br /><br />6. The kernel loads the init process. 
202;;1;What are the two main Linux bootloaders?;LILO (LInux LOader)<br><br>GRUB (GRand Unified Boatloader) 
203;;2;What are two ways to install the LILO bootloader?;1. On installation of certain distributions.<br /><br />2. Installing the LILO package on the system and then running lilo at the shell&nbsp &nbsp prompt.<br><br>Before you do this you must first configure the LILO configuration file in /etc.
204;;2;In what location is the LILO bootloader configuration file?;/etc/lilo.conf
205;;2;What are the two main categories of options in the lilo.conf?;1. Global options.<br><br>2. Options for various images.
206;;2;What are some common global options for lilo.conf file?;boot=&lt boot-device&gt <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sets the name of the device (e.g. a hard disk partition) that contains the boot sector.<br><br>menu-scheme=&lt color-scheme&gt <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The default color scheme of the boot menu may be overridden on VGA displays using this option. (The color scheme of MDA displays is fixed.) The general color-scheme string is of the form:<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt text&gt :&lt highlight&gt :&lt border&gt :&lt title&gt <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp where each entry is two characters which specify a foreground color and a background color. Only the first entry is required.<br><br>timeout=&lt tsecs&gt <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp sets a timeout (in tenths of a second) for keyboard input at the boot: prompt. &quot timeout&quot  only has meaning if &quot prompt&quot  is mentioned. If no key is pressed for the specified time, the default image is automatically booted. The default timeout is infinite. <br><br>change-rules<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Defines boot-time changes to partition type numbers ('hiding').<br><br>reset<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specifies that all default change-rules are removed. <br><br>prompt<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specifies that the boot: prompt be displayed.<br><br>read-only<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specifies that the root (/) file system be mounted read-only at first. After checking the integrity of the file system, the kernel will usually remount the file system in read-write mode. <br><br>default=&lt name&gt <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uses the specified image as the default boot image.<br><br>message=&lt message-file&gt <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specifies a file containing a message that is displayed before the boot prompt. <br><br>
207;;2;What are some image options in the lilo.conf file? ;A per-image section starts with either a line<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp image=pathname<br /><br />(to indicate a file or device containing the boot image of a Linux kernel), or a line<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp other=pathname<br /><br />to indicate an arbitrary system to boot. <br /><br />append=string<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Appends the options specified to the parameter line passed to the kernel. This is typically used to specify parameters of hardware that can't be entirely auto-detected or for which probing may be dangerous. <br /><br />vga=mode<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This specifies the VGA text mode that should be selected when booting. <br /><br />initrd<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specifies the initial ramdisk image to be loaded with the kernel. Usually this is set to /boot/initrd or /boot/initrd-version.<br /><br />root=root-device<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This specifies the device that should be mounted as root.
208;;2;What must you do after modifying the lilo.conf file in a text editor?;Run the command lilo from the shell prompt. 
209;;2;What command option can you use with the lilo command to specify where the bootloader should be installed?;lilo -b bootdev<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specify the boot device  i.e., where the boot loader will be installed. &quot -b /dev/hda&quot  specifies the Master Boot Record  &quot -b /dev/sdb5&quot  specifies the first extended partition on the second SCSI disk.
210;;2;What is the ELILO bootloader for?;It is used on hardware that is not compatilbe with the standard version of LILO. It can boot a Linux kernel on the IA-64 (IPF) and IA-32 (x86) EFI-based hardware platforms. 
211;;2;What are the stages of the GRUB bootloader?;-- Stage 1: <br><br>This stage of GRUB is usually stored in the MBR. Its only real job is to point to the location os Stage 1.5 or Stage 2.<br><br>-- Stage 1.5:<br><br>This stage of GRUB is located in the first 30 KB of the hard drive immediately after the MBR, but before the first partition. Stage 1.5 contains any drivers needed to load Stage 2. It is possible for Stage 1 to skip Stage 1.5.<br><br>-- Stage 2:<br><br>This stage of GRUB is stored in a disk partition. When loaded by Stage 1 or Stage 1.5 , Stage2 presents a graphical menu on the screen that allows the user to select the kernel image that should be loaded. <br>
212;;3;What is a big difference between LILO and GRUB for loading?;After it's intially installed, you can modify your configuration files and the changes will be applied the next time GRUB is loaded because Stage 2 reads directly from the configuration file on disk. 
213;;3;What is the syntax for installing the GRUB bootloader?;In order to install GRUB under a UNIX-like OS (such as gnu), invoke the program grub-install as the superuser (root).<br /><br />The usage is basically very simple. You only need to specify one argument to the program, namely, where to install the boot loader. The argument has to be a device file (like ‘/dev/hda’). If no location is provided then the default is /boot. For example, under Linux the following will install GRUB into the MBR of the first IDE disk:<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # grub-install /dev/hda<br />
214;;3;What are some common file locations for the GRUB file on different distributions?;Fedora, Red Hat - /boot/grub/grub.conf<br /><br />SUSE - /boot/grub/menu.lst<br /><br />Ubuntu has no /boot/grub/menu.lst. It has been replaced by /boot/grub/grub.cfg. <br /><br />Fedora also symbolically links the /boot/grub/menu.lst to /boot/grub/grub.conf. Then /etc/grub.conf file to /boot/grub/grub.conf. <br /><br />
215;;3;Instead of listing the devices like LILO in the using of a /dev entry what is the format for listing in GRUB?;hddrive_number, partition_number<br /><br />For example, the first partition on the firts hard drive (/dev/sda1) is referenced by GRUB as hd0,0. It doesn't matter if the first disk is an IDE, STAT, or SCSI drive. 
216;;3;What does GRUB do with root?;GRUB creates its own &quot root&quot  called the GRUB root. It's the partition where the /boot directory resides (where Stage 2 is installed). <br><br>If /boot is created on it's own partition then this partition becomes the GRUB root. If /boot is not in its own partition then the path will be /boot/grub
217;;3;What are some of the global listings for the GRUB configuration file?;color &lt normal-color&gt &lt selected-color&gt  <br /><br />Allows specific colors to be used in the menu, where two colors are configured as the foreground and background.<br /><br />default=&lt integer&gt  <br /><br />Replace &lt integer&gt  with the default entry title number to be loaded if the menu interface times out. <br />Specifies the menu item that will be booted automatically if the user doesn't make a manual selection. <br /><br />timeout=&lt integer&gt <br /><br />Specifies the interval, in seconds, that GRUB waits before loading the entry designated in the default command. <br /><br />gfxmenu<br /><br />Specifies the location of the image file that will be used to display the graphical GRUB boot menu. <br />Example:<br />gfxmenu (hd0,2)/boot/message 
218;;3;What are some title options in the GRUB configuration file for title?;title<br /><br />Specifies the title of the menu item in the GRUB boot menu.<br /><br />root<br /><br />Specifies the location of the partition that is to be mounted as the GRUB root. This file defines the parameters and options needed by the grub command to install the boot loader correctly:<br /><br />root (hd0,4)<br /><br />kernel<br /><br />Specifies the location of the Linux kernel. Some distributions will point to a symbolic link of /boot/vmlinuz which points to the real kernel file. <br /><br />The root= option specifies the partition that will be mounted as the root file system. The vga= option specifies the VGA mode the system should use during boot. The resume= option points to the system's swap partition. <br /><br />Example:<br /><br />kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.34-12-desktop root=/dev/sda2 resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts vga=0x317<br /><br />initrd<br /><br />Specifies the initrd image that should be used by GRUB to create the initial ramdisk image during boot. Some distributions point to a link file of of /boot/initrd. 
219;;3;What are some edit options for the GRUB menu on boot up?;Move up and down with the arrow keys and press E to edit. <br><br>To add a new line press O. <br><br>To delete a line press D.<br><br>To start the boot process press B. <br><br>Pressing ESC will go back to the GRUB menu. <br><br>You can also access the GRUB prompt by entering C. This brings up this prompt:<br><br>grub&gt  <br><br>You can enter help at this prompt. Pressing TAB will bring a up list of GRUB commands. This is useful for sending boot options to the Linux kernel often helping with boot issues. The syntax for doing so is init=program_name. <br><br>Example:<br><br>init=/bin/bash<br><br>This could be used to rescue the root password. <br><br>From within a running Linux system you can access the GRUB boot prompt by entering grub. 
220;;4;What is the syntax for when you specified a GRUB boot option of init=/bin/bash in trying to recover the root pass word, but the file system mounts read-only?;Once in remount it in read-write mode with this syntax:<br><br>mount -o remount,rw,sync -t filesystem device_name mount_point<br><br>After making the nessary changes, you can tell the kernel to resume the normal boot process via init by entering exec /sbin/init at the shell prompt. 
221;;4;What can you do to increase the security of the GRUB menu?;You can add a GRUB&nbsp &nbsp password. The simpliest way to dothis is to edit your GRUB configuration file (menu.lst or grub.conf) and enter the following:<br /><br />password your_password<br><br>When placed in the global section of the file it defines the password for all the title directives that come after. 
222;;4;Beside the normal lock on the GRUB boot menu what other safety option can you use on menu options?;Command: lock<br /><br />lock<br /><br />Prevent normal users from executing arbitrary menu entries. You must use the command password if you really want this command to be useful (see password).<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This command is used in a menu, as shown in this example:<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp title This entry is too dangerous to be executed by normal users<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp lock<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp root (hd0,a)<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp kernel /no-security-os<br><br>If you want to define different passwords for each GRUB menu item, you can place:<br><br>password your_password<br><br>directives within each title element. <br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
223;;4;What command can you use to encrypt the GRUB password?;At the shell prompt:<br><br>grub-md5-crypt<br><br>You will then be prompted to enter the your password to assign to the GRUB menu. <br><br>When complete the hash form of the password is displayed on the screen. Then open GRUB in a text editor and enter:<br><br>password --md5 ************hashed_password************
224;;4;What are the seven Linux run levels?;0 - Halts the system.<br><br>1 - runs the Linux in single-user mode. The command-line interface is used.<br><br>2 - Runs the Linux in multiuser mode with networking disabled. The command-line interface is used. <br><br>3 - Runs Linux is multiuser mode with networking enabled. The command-line interface is used.<br><br>4 - Undefined by default. You can edit the /etc/inittab file and define your own custom runlevel using runlevel 4. <br><br>5 - Runs Linux in multiuser mode with networking enabled. The graphical user interface is used. <br><br>6 - Reboots the system. 
225;;4;What is upstart?;Upstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running.<br /><br />The &quot init&quot  or &quot system initialisation&quot  process on Unix and Linux systems has process ID (PID) &quot 1&quot . That is to say, it is the first process to start when the system boots (ignoring the initrd/initramfs). As the quote shows, Upstart is an &quot init&quot  replacement for the traditional Unix &quot System V&quot  &quot init&quot  system. Upstart provides the same facilities as the traditional &quot init&quot  system.<br><br>/etc/init is where the upstart init configs live. While they are not scripts themselves, they essentially execute whatever is required to replace sysvinit scripts.<br><br>/etc/init.d is where all the traditional sysvinit scripts and the backward compatible scripts for upstart live. The backward compatible scripts basically run service myservice start instead of doing anything themselves. Some just show a notice to use the &quot service&quot  command.<br><br>/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf controls execution of traditional scripts added manually or with update-rc.d to traditional runlevels in /etc/rc*<br><br>/etc/default has configuration files allowing you to control the behaviour of both traditional sysvinit scripts and new upstart configs
226;;4;What is location for most distributions outside of Ubuntu for the runlevel configuration file?;Runlevels are defined through the /etc/inittab file. <br><br>
227;;4;What is the grandparent of all other&nbsp &nbsp processes on your Linux system? ;init process<br><br>It is the first process run by the kernel at boot and is responsible for loading all other system processes. 
228;;5;After the first parameter defining the the run level in initab what is listed?;The inittab file telss the init process to run the /etc/init.d/boot script. <br /><br />Example:<br /><br />s1:bootwait:/etc/init.d/boot<br /><br />The bootwiat parameter tells init to run this script and to wait for it to complete before proceeding with the boot proces. <br /><br />It also defines what init scripts are run in each runlevel. <br /><br />Example:<br /><br />10:0:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 0<br />11:1:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 1<br />12:2:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 2<br />13:3:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 3<br />#14:4:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 4<br />15:5:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 5<br />16:6:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 6<br /><br />The syntax is identifier:runlevel:action:command
229;;5;What line in inittab controls what happens when CRTL-ALT-DEL is pressed?;ca:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -r -t 4 now
230;;5;What is the line in initab responsible for running single user mode?;ls:S:wait:/etc/init.d/rc S<br />~~:S:respawn:/sbin/sulogin<br /><br />To enter single-user mode while the system is running, enter at the shell prompt:<br /><br />init S<br /><br />You will then be prompted for the root user password and as a result given root access. <br /><br />You can also enter single-user mode at system startup by entering S in the Boot Options field of the GRUB menu. 
231;;5;What file tells the system what to do on a power failure?;Depending on the failure the inittab file provides a different script file in /etc/init.d to run. <br><br>Example:<br><br>pf::powerwait:/etc/inti.d/powerfail start<br>pn::powerfailnow:/etc/init.d/powerfail now<br>#pn::powerfail:/etc/init.d/powerfail now<br>po::powerokwait:/etc/init.d/powerfail stop
232;;5;What file tells which login processes (called Get TTY or getty processes) are started at the login?;The inittab file tells init which runlevel loging processes are started at login to prompt the user to enter a username and password.<br><br>Example:<br><br>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --noclear tty1<br>2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2<br>3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3<br>4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4<br>5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5<br>6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6
233;;5;What must you do with the inittab file after making changes?;Run the command init q.
234;;5;How are system processes started and stopped on Linux systems?;They use an init script.<br /><br />Most Linux distributions use one of two types of init scripts:<br /><br />1. System V Linux distributions that use System V init scripts store them in the /etc/rc.d directory. Within /etc/rc.d are a series of subdirectories named rc0.d through rc6.d. Each of these directories is associated with a particular runlevel. In the subdirectories are symbolic links pointing to init scripts for the system daemons in /etc/init.d. Red Hat and Fedora use System V-type init scripts. <br /><br />2. BSD Linux distributions use BSD-style init scripts store them in the /etc/init.d directory. Like System V directories rc0.d through rc6.d are associated with certain run levels. These directories contain links that point to the init scripts in /etc/init.d. SUSE uses this type of init script. 
235;;5;What is the basic syntax for running a script in the shell prompt?;In a BSD style system:<br /><br />/etc/init.d/script_name start | stop | restart | status | reload<br /><br />In a System V style system:<br /><br />/etc/rc.d/init.d/script_name<br><br>On some systems the service can be run without the full path to the script file.<br><br>rescript_name start | stop | restart
236;;5;What are some important script files in /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d?;rc - BSD and System V - This script is used to switch between runlevels while the system is running. <br><br>halt - BSD - This script can stop or reboot your system. It is run if the current runlevel is changed to 0 or 6.<br><br>boot - BSD - These scripts run byinti accomplish a variety of startup task. It runs the scripts contained in /etc/init.d/boot.d.<br><br>boot.local - BSD - The script is alsorun at startup by init. If you want to run a particular command at startup you put it here?<br><br>rc.sysinit - System V - This script's function is similar to theboot script on a BSD-type system. It's used to set the path, check the file system for errors, set the system clock, etc.<br><br>rc.local - System V - This script's function is similar to that of the boot.local script on a BSD-type system. You can add commandsto this script for start at boot time.<br>
237;;6;What are the basic processes init completes on a BSD-type system?;1. Runs the /etc/init.d/boot script to prepare the system.<br><br>2. Processes /etc/inittab to determine the appropriate runlevel and scripts.<br><br>3. Runs the scripts in the appropriate runlevel directory in /etc/init.d.<br><br>4. Runs the /etc/init.d/boot.local script. 
238;;6;On a System V-type system what does the init process do on boot up?;1. Runs the /etc/rc.d/sysinit script to prepare the system.<br><br>2. Processes /etc/inittab to determine the appropriate runlevel and scripts.<br><br>3. Runs the scripts in the appropriate runlevel directory in /etc/rc.d/.<br><br>4. runs the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script.
239;;6;What is the syntax for changing the runlevel at the shell prompt?;init runlevel<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />init 3<br /><br />You must switch to the root user account before you can run the init command.<br><br>For some distributions you can also use the command telinit.
240;;6;If you look inside an rcX.d directory within your distribution' init directory what two types of scripts will you see?;K - Scripts that start with K are used to stop (kill) a process. They call the script with the stop parameter.<br><br>S - Scripts that start with S are used to start a process. They call the script with the start parameter.<br><br>They are actually symbolic links that point to real script files in your init script directory. <br><br>Scripts are numbered and will run in order. 
241;;6;How can you change the runlevel at boot?;Add the run level to the end of the boot options.<br><br>Example:<br><br>Boot Options vga+0x317 3<br><br>To give a runlevel of 3.
242;;6;What commands can you use to change the runlevels that each of your init scripts are associated with?;chkconfig<br><br>insserv<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp insserv enables an installed system&nbsp &nbsp init&nbsp &nbsp script&nbsp &nbsp (`boot&nbsp &nbsp script')&nbsp &nbsp by<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp reading the comment header of the script, e.g.:<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ### BEGIN INIT INFO<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Provides:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Required-Start:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Required-Stop:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Should-Start:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Should-Stop:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # X-Start-Before:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # X-Stop-After:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Default-Start:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Default-Stop:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # X-Interactive:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp true<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Short-Description: single_line_description<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # Description:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp multiline_description<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ### END INIT INFO<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and&nbsp &nbsp calculating the dependencies between all scripts.&nbsp &nbsp Please be aware<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp that the line<br><br /><br /><br><br>
243;;7;What is in the INIT INFO block of each init script?;The runlevels the associated service should run in by default. <br><br>The key information provided is:<br><br>Provides - The service the init script manages.<br><br>Required-Start - The services that must be started before this service can start.<br><br>Default-Start - The default runlevels that the daemon should run in. <br><br>Default-Stop - The default runlevels that the daemon should not run in. 
244;;7;The syntax for the insserv command is insserv service_name. What are some useful options?;insserv - r service_name<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -r, --remove<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remove the listed scripts from all runlevels.<br><br>insserver -d service_name<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -d, --default<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Use default runlevels a defined in the scripts.&nbsp &nbsp This may restore an edited runlevel link scheme.<br><br>This is often used after editing the init script and changing the Default-Start and Default-Stop parameters in the INIT INFO block. 
245;;7;Using chkconfig what is the syntax for displaying a service's runlevel configuration?;chkconfig -I daemon_name
246;;7;Using chkconfig what is the syntax to have a daemon to start at its default runlevel?;chkconfig daemon_name on<br><br>To disable a service run<br><br>chkconfig daemon_name off
247;;7;Using chkconfig what is the syntax for changing the NTP daemon to runlevel 3 and 5?;chkconfig -s ntp 35
248;;7;What are some proper ways to shutdown the system through the command line?;init 0 - Switches the system to runlevel 0, which halts the system.<br /><br />init 6 - Switches the system to runlevel 6, which reboots the system.<br /><br />halt - Shuts down the system. <br /><br />reboot - Reboots the system.<br /><br />shutdown &lt options&gt  - The advantage of the command shutdown is the options available like specifying a time, sending a message, and it does not allow other user to sign in before the pending shutdown. The syntax for using shutdown is:<br /><br />shutdown +m -h|-r message<br /><br />You can also use the now option instead of +m for immediate shutdown. Time is entered as hh:mm. The -h option specifies that the system be halted and the -r option specifies a reboot. <br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -k&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only send out the warning messages and disable&nbsp &nbsp logins,&nbsp &nbsp do&nbsp &nbsp not<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp actually bring the system down.<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -P&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Requests that the system&nbsp &nbsp be&nbsp &nbsp powered&nbsp &nbsp off&nbsp &nbsp after&nbsp &nbsp it&nbsp &nbsp has&nbsp &nbsp been<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp brought down.<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -H&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Requests&nbsp &nbsp that&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp system&nbsp &nbsp be halted after it has been brought<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp down.<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -c&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cancels&nbsp &nbsp a&nbsp &nbsp running&nbsp &nbsp shutdown.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />
249;;192;What are the components of the Linux GUI?;1. X Server - The X server software is the component that draws windows graphically on the display screen. It also manages the keyboard and mouse. The X server can display the GUI on another system in the network that is also running the X server software. This is controlled with the DISPLAY enviromental variable.&nbsp &nbsp <br /><br />Some different X server softwares are:<br /><br />X.org-X11 - This is the most commonly implemented X server system. <br /><br />XFree86 - Until around 2004, XFree86 was the default version of X server used by most distributions. There were license issues that drove the developement of X.org.<br /><br />2. Window Manager - The window manager customizes how the windows look and behave. Popular window managers include enlightenment, fvwm, kwin, sawfish, twn, and wmaker.<br /><br />3. Destop Environment - It manages a series of tools that ties your GUI components together. Two popular enviroments are KDE and GNOME. 
250;;192;What is the basic design of X window system?;The X window system breaks the graphical interface into:<br><br>-- Display server<br><br>-- clients<br><br>The display server and the clients need not be on the same machine. <br><br>
251;;192;What year did Open Group form X.org?;1999
252;;192;What could you possibly use if your hardware does not support X window?;It is possible that you may be able to run in VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) framebuffer mode.<br><br>Modern monitors implement the VESA Display Data Channel (or DDC) specification, which allows monitor information and capabilities to be determined programatically. The XFree86 configuration tools (other than xf86config) use this information to configure your X system. 
253;;192;What is the usual configuration file for the X window?;xorg.conf
254;;192;What are some of the possible locations for the xorg.conf X window configuration file depending on distribution?;You may find it in one of several places: <br /><br />/etc/xorg.conf<br />/etc/X11/xorg.conf<br />/usr/X11R6/etc/xorg.conf<br />/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xorg.conf.hostname<br />/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xorg.conf
255;;192;What are some of the basic configuration tools for X.org?;The available configuration tools are:<br /><br />X -configure<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Running X with the -configure option causes the X server to load each driver module, probe for the driver, and create a configuration file that is saved in the home directory of the user who started the server (usually /root). The file is called xorg.conf.new. <br /><br />xorgcfg<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The xorgcfg command attempts to start the display and input drivers. If it is successful, you will see a window with a diagram of your system. Right-click an item to view or update its configuration. On some systems you may need to use the numeric keypad instead of mouse buttons, because the mouse was not properly detected. You may wish to try creating a symbolic link to /dev/mouse from your actual mouse device before running xorgcfg. For example:<br /><br />ln -s /dev/input/mice /dev/mouse<br /><br />xorg86config<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The xorg86config command uses a text-mode interface to interactively prompt for information about your mouse, keyboard, video card, and display. You will need horizontal and vertical frequency information for your display. You can select most video cards from a database of known video cards. If not, you may need specific chipset and timing information for your card. 
256;;192;What are some common sections of the xorg.conf file?;Files - Points to files needed for xorg to operate.<br /><br />ServerFlags - Global X server options that may be overriden by options with the same name listed in the ServerLayout section. <br /><br />Module - This section tells the X server to load certain server extension and font rasterizer modules at startup. The &quot Load &lt modulename&gt  directive tells the X server to load the specified module. <br /><br />InputDevice - This section configures the X server with the input devices it should use. This could be devided into sections  for example the keyboard and mouse could have seperate sections. <br /><br />Modes - They define video modes the X server may use. <br /><br />Modeline - Defines video modes for the monitor. <br /><br />Screen - Binds your video board to your monitor. This can include multiple Display subsections. <br /><br />Device - Specifies settings for the video board. <br /><br />Monitor - Specifies settings for the monitor connected to your display adapter. <br /><br />Indentifier - This directive defines a unique name for the video adapter. <br /><br />Extensions - Extension enabling. <br /><br />DRI - DRI-specific configuration<br /><br />Vendor - Vendor-specific configuration<br /><br />ServerLayout - The ServerLayout section binds together one or more screen sections and one or more InputDevice sections. <br /><br />
257;;192;What are four components of the Modeline directive in xorg.conf?;The Modeline directive is used to define video modes for the monitor.<br /><br />1. Pixel clock in MHz.<br /><br />2. Horizontal timing listing four numbers that specify the horizontal timing: hdisp, hsyncstart, hsyncend, and htotal. <br /><br />3. Vertical timing listing four numbers that specify the veritical timing: vdisp, vsyncstart, vsyncend, and vtotal.<br /><br />4. Flags used to set the polarity of the hsync and vsync signals. 
258;;193;The device-id used in the Device directive in Screen section of the xorg.conf must match what other directive?;The Identifier directive within the Device section of the file.
259;;193;What are some of the directives in the Display subsection of the Screen directive in xorg.conf?;1.&nbsp &nbsp Depth - depth - specifies the color depth as the number of bits per pixel.<br><br>2. Modes - mode_name - Specifies the list of video modes to use. <br><br>3. ViewPort - x y - Sets the upper-left corner of the display. <br>
260;;193;What are the directives for the Monitor section for the xorg.conf file?;Indentifier - &quot name&quot  - Defines a unique name for the monitor. <br /><br />VendorName - &quot vendor&quot  - Specifies the monitor manufacturer.<br /><br />ModelName - &quot model&quot  - Specifies the monitor model. <br /><br />HorizSync - sync_range - Defines the horizontal sync frequency range supported by the monitor in KHz. <br /><br />VertRefresh - refresh_rate - Defines the vertical sync frequency range supported by the monitor in KHz. 
261;;193;What are some of the directives in the ServerLayout section of the xorg.conf file?;Indentifier - &quot name&quot  - Defines a unique name for the server layout. <br /><br />Screen - &quot screen_id&quot  - Specifies which screen parameters to use. <br /><br />InputDevice - &quot input_device_id&quot  - Specifies which input devices are to be used for the server layout. You need one directive for each input device. <br /><br />Option - &quot option_name&quot  - Any option in the ServerFlags section can be specified here. The ServerLayout section overrides the option listed in the ServerFlags section. 
262;;193;What are some different utilities used to modify the xorg.conf file?;system-config-display<br /><br />system-config-keyboard<br /><br />system-config-mouse <br /><br />X.org also has its own basic utility called xorgconfig for configuring in a text-based environment. The xorgconf utility tries to automatically detect your hardware. 
263;;193;What command can you use to have Xorg try to automatically detect all of your hardware and create a test file called xorg.conf.new?;Xorg -configure<br><br>You can then test this file with<br><br>X -config /root/xorg.conf.new
264;;193;What are some utilities for configuring XFree86 for X server?;XFree-86 - configure<br><br>Detects your hardware and creates a files named /etc/X11/XFr86Config.new for review before renaming to XFr86Config.<br><br>xf86config<br><br>A text-based X serve configuration utility.<br><br>xf86cfg<br><br>A graphical X server configuration utility.
265;;193;If something is misconfigured and your X server software hangs how can you kill the process?;CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
266;;193;If you are at run level 3 and want to start the Linux GUI what command can you run?;startx<br><br>or<br><br>X
267;;193;Most systems don't ship with an X config file any more, but sometimes you need one. What is the basic skelton?;Section &quot Device&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Identifier&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot Configured Video Device&quot <br>EndSection<br><br>Section &quot Monitor&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Identifier&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot Configured Monitor&quot <br>EndSection<br><br>Section &quot Screen&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Identifier&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot Default Screen&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Monitor&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot Configured Monitor&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Device&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot Configured Video Device&quot <br>EndSection
268;;193;Most distributions now have what folder containing configuration information for the X server instead on a xorg.conf file?;/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d<br><br>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
269;;194;If your distribution is running x.org where could your fonts directory be installed?;/usr/share/X11/fonts<br><br>/usr/share/fonts
270;;194;What two varieties of fonts come with Linux ditributions?;Bitmap fonts -- These are the oldest fonts using pixels to represent characters. The do not require much resources, but scale poorly. <br><br>Scalable fonts -- Scalable fonts use vector lines that are dynamically sized as needed. These come in two commonly used formats:<br><br>1. PostScript Type 1 (in the Type1 directory).<br><br>2. TrueType (in the truetype directory). 
271;;194;What are the general steps for installing a font?;1. Copy the fonts to the directory: Copy the .pfa or .pba file to the Type1 folder, copy the .ttf file to the TrueType folder, or copy the Bitmap font files to either the 100dpi and/or 75dpi folder. <br /><br />2. Create a font description file and register it with the system through a root terminal session. <br /><br />mkfontscale<br />mkfontdir<br /><br />These commands make an index of scalable and bitmap font files for the X server. <br /><br />3. Open port 7100 of the X font server. If you have installed off the default path you will need to add a FontPath directive. <br /><br />4. Edit the /etc/X11/fs/config telling the X font service (xfs) where the fonts for the X server clients are. <br /><br />Remove the comment on the no-listen = tcp line.<br /><br />Check the catalog = section to verify that your fonts directory is listed. <br /><br />5. Switch to the init script directory and enter ./xfs start as root. <br /><br />6. If desired use the insserv or chkconfig commands to configure the xfs daemon to start every time the system boots. <br /><br />7. Restart the X server. 
272;;194;What are the general steps for configuring remote X servers to access the font server?;1. Open the X server configuration file (possibly xorg.conf) and locate the files section. In this section, add a new FontPath directive for the X font server. <br><br>Syntax:<br><br>Section &quot Files&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ...<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp FontPath &quot tcp/server_address:7100&quot <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ...<br>EndSection<br><br>2. Open port 7100 on your host firewall. <br><br>3. Restart the X server. <br>
273;;194;For CentOS what steps can you take to change the window manager?;To run any of the aforementioned window managers, you will first need to boot into Runlevel 3. <br /><br />Once you are logged in to Runlevel 3, you will be presented with a terminal prompt, not a graphical environment. To start a window manager, type xinit -e &lt path-to-window-manager&gt  at the prompt.<br /><br />&lt path-to-window-manager&gt  is the location of the window manager binary file. The binary file can be located by typing which window-manager-name, where window-manager-name is the name of the window manager you want to run.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />user@host# which twm /usr/bin/twm<br />user@host# xinit -e /usr/bin/twm<br /><br />The first command above returns the absolute path to the twm window manager, the second command starts twm.<br /><br />To exit a window manager, close the last window or press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace. Once you have exited the window manager, you can log back into Runlevel 5 by typing startx at the prompt.

276;;194;What are some of the typical locations of the different display manager configuration files?;xdm - /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config<br /><br />kdm - The KDE display manager is actually based on xdm and usually uses the xdm configuration files. Some distributions store the kdm settings in /etc/kde/kdm or /etc/X11/kdm. In these cases you will use the kdmrc file in either of these directories to make most of the configuration changes. <br /><br />gdm - /etc/X11/gdm<br /><br />The distribution openSUSE has many of the configuration settings stored in the /etc/sysconfig/displaymanager file. <br /><br />
277;;195;What does the Xresources file do for the xdm display manager. ;The Xresources file in the /etc/X11/xdm directory is used to cutomize the login interface presented to the user.
278;;195;What port does the xdm Control Protocol (XDMCP) listen on?;Port 177 <br /><br />1. The xdm host needs to be configured to listen for the inbound connection requests from the X server software on the thin clients. <br /><br />If you are running xdm or kdm edit the /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers file and find the line<br /><br />:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -nolisten tcp -br vt7<br /><br />Remove the -nolisten option, save changes to the file and restart the system. <br /><br />If you are running gdm, edit the /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf file and modify to DisallowTCP=false.<br /><br />If you are running openSUSE edit the /etc/sysconfig/displaymanager file to:<br /><br />DISPLAYMANAGER REMOTE_ACCESS=&quot yes&quot <br />DISPLAYMANAGER_XSERVER_TCP_PORT_6000_OPEN=&quot yes&quot <br /><br />2. Open port 177 in the xdm host's firewall. <br /><br />3. Open the /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess files on the xdm host in an editor. This file is used to configure access control for XDMCP connections. You can add an entry for each remote thin client system or add the domain like *.mydomain.com. <br /><br />To restrict certain clients for connection add them with an exclamation point: !some_client.mydomain.com.

316;;168;Usually when you download a source code what must you do first?;Unzip the file.<br /><br />tar -zxvf filename<br /><br />-z tells tar to use gzip to decompress the tarball first. <br /><br />-x option tells tar to extract the files from the decompressed archive file. <br /><br />-v tells tar to operate verbosely.<br /><br />-f option tells tar the name of the file to extract.
317;;168;After unzipping the source code what is needed next before installing?;You must compile the installation files. Verify you are in the directory created when the tarball was extracted then run this command:<br /><br />./configure<br /><br />The configure script does two things.<br /><br />1. It checks your system to make sure all the necessary components required to compile the program are available. One of the most important is the existence of a compiler compatible with the C language like gcc or gcc-c++.<br /><br />2. It creates a file called Makefile. The Makefile contains specific instructions for how the executable should be complied to run on your platform. <br />
318;;169;What command is used to compile the text-based source code into a binary executed file with a C compiler?;make<br /><br /><br />After it is compiled use the command<br /><br /><br />make install
319;;169;What are the four basic commands for installation of source code?;1. Cd to the directory where you saved the source TAR. Run either<br /><br />tar -zxvf ./some_program-version.tar.gz<br /><br />or gzip first. You can check this by running:<br /><br />file some_program-version.tar.gz<br /><br />Which will tell you what type of file it expects it is. <br /><br />2. Cd to the directory created by the unzip and verify the file with the ls command. If you are sure there is a C compiler installed run:<br /><br />./configure<br /><br />3.

366;;185;On Debian based systems what should be used to add a user other than useradd?;adduser
367;;185;What file has the default value a users will get when added with the useradd command? ;/etc/default/useradd<br /><br /><br />This provides the shell, home directory location, possible expire date, the directory containing the skeleton directory, the mail spool directory, and the default group ID.
368;;185;On Debian what is the default behavior for group ID and name when the -n or -g options are not specified?;The default group for users 100=users on Debian systems<br>This is the same as USERS_GID in adduser.<br>This argument is used when the -n flag is specified.<br>The default behavior (when -n and -g are not specified) is to create a primary user group with the same name as the user being added to the system.<br>GROUP=100<br><br />
369;;186;In Debian systems using the useradd command create a group and add a user to that group. ;$ sudo groupadd some_group<br />$ sudo useradd -G some_group some_user
370;;186;What command option can you use with useradd to view the default options used with the command?;useradd -D
371;;186;The command useradd will use what files for default parameters?;/etc/default/useradd<br><br /><br>/etc/login.defs<br><br /><br>/etc/skel

373;;186;What is typically in the /etc/skel directory?;Depending on distribution this usually contains configuration files such as .bashrc, .fonts, .bash_history, and .profile.
374;;186;What option can you give to the useradd command to add the user's full name?;-c<br><br /><br>Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is currently used as the field for the user's full name.<br><br /><br><br /><br><br />
375;;187;How can you specify with the useradd command an end date for the user account to be disabled?;useradd -e yyyy-mm-dd user_name<br><br /><br>-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE<br><br /><br>The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.<br><br /><br><br />
376;;187;What option to useradd -f disables the number of days the password expires with the -f option?;useradd -f -1 user_name<br><br /><br>A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the password has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature.<br><br /><br>If not specified, useradd will use the default inactivity period specified by the INACTIVE variable in /etc/default/useradd, or -1 by default.<br><br />
377;;187;With the command useradd how do you add an user to a group?;useradd -g group_name user_name<br />-g, --gid GROUP<br /><br />The group name or number of the user's initial login group. The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.<br /><br />If not specified, the behavior of useradd will depend on the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.<br /><br /><br /><br />
378;;187;How do you add the user to multiple groups with useradd?;useradd -G group1,group2 user_name<br><br /><br>-G, --groups <br><br /><br>Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace.<br><br /><br><br />
379;;187;How can you use useradd to create a user without a home directory?;useradd -M user_name
380;;187;On Red Hat or Fedora systems useradd creates a new group each time it is used. How can you turn this off?;useradd -n user_name
381;;188;What is needed if you use the -p option with useradd?;The password must already be encrypted. You can create the encrypted password with 'opensll passwd' command. 
382;;188;How can you use useradd to create a system account?;useradd -r system_account_name<br /><br />-r, --system, Create a system account.<br /><br />System users will be created with no aging information in /etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are chosen in the SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in /etc/login.defs, instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the creation of groups).<br /><br />Note that useradd will not create a home directory for such an user, regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs.
383;;188;What option can be used with user add to specify the default shell for a user?;-s, --shell SHELL<br><br /><br>The name of the user's login shell. The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to select the default login shell specified by the SHELL variable in /etc/default/useradd, or an empty string by default.<br><br />
384;;188;Using the command useradd create a user with these properties:<br /><br /><br />username: uuser<br />full name: unknown user<br />shell: /bin/bash<br />password is entered encrypted with MD5<br />create a home directory<br />password before encryption: password<br /><br />;useradd -c &quot unknown user&quot  -m -p $(echo &quot password&quot  | openssl passwd -1 -stdin) -s &quot /bin/bash&quot  uuser
385;;188;What does not happen with useradd unless you use the -p option?;The user will not have password.<br><br /><br>To fix this run as root:<br><br /><br>passwd user_name<br><br /><br>Then enter the password at the prompt.
386;;188;What are the fields in the passwd -S user_name output?;-S, --status<br /><br /><br />Display account status information. The status information consists of 7 fields. The first field is the user´s login name. The second field indicates if the user account is locked (L), has no password (NP), or has a usable password (P). The third field gives the date of the last password change. The next four fields are the minimum age, maximum age, warning period, and inactivity period for the password. These ages are expressed in days.
387;;189;What option with the passwd command can lock the account?;-l, --lock<br><br /><br>Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a password by changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value (it adds a ´!´ at the beginning of the password).<br><br /><br>Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be able to login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key). To disable the account, administrators should use usermod --expiredate 1.
388;;189;What option with the passwd command can be used to unlock the account?;-u, --unlock<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Unlock the password of the named account. This option re-enables a password by changing the password back to its previous value (to the value before using the -l option).
389;;189;What option with the passwd command will remove a users pasword?;-d, --delete<br /><br /><br />Delete a user's password (make it empty). This is a quick way to disable a password for an account. It will set the named account passwordless.<br /><br />
390;;189;What is the option for the passwd command to set the minimum amount of days before a password can be changed?;-n, --mindays MIN_DAYS<br><br /><br>Set the minimum number of days between password changes to MIN_DAYS. A value of zero for this field indicates that the user may change his/her password at any time.<br><br />
391;;189;What is the option with the passwd command that sets the maximum number of days before a password must be changed?;-x, --maxdays MAX_DAYS<br><br /><br>Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid. After MAX_DAYS, the password is required to be changed.<br><br />
392;;189;How can you set the number of days prior a user will get a warning of the pending password expiration?;passwd -w #_days user_name<br><br /><br>-w, --warndays WARN_DAYS<br><br /><br>Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required. The WARN_DAYS option is the number of days prior to the password expiring that a user will be warned that his/her password is about to expire.<br><br /><br><br />
393;;189;How can you set with the passwd command the number of days after expiration a user account will be disabled?;passwd -i #_days user_name<br><br /><br>-i, --inactive INACTIVE<br><br /><br>This option is used to disable an account after the password has been expired for a number of days. After a user account has had an expired password for INACTIVE days, the user may no longer sign on to the account.<br><br />
394;;190;What command and options would you use to change system account files in the comment session?;usermod -c user_name comment
395;;190;What command option for usermod sets the date when the account will be disabled?;-e EXPIRE_DATE<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
396;;190;With usermod what is the option to set the number of days after expiration before the account is disabled?;-f, INACTIVE<br /><br /><br />The number of days after a password expires until the account is permanently disabled. Use a value of -1 to disable this function.<br /><br />
397;;190;What options with the usermod can specify the default group and additional groups?;-g group_name<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />The group name or number of the user's new initial login group. The group must exist.<br /><br />Any file from the user's home directory owned by the previous primary group of the user will be owned by this new group.<br /><br />-G GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions as the group given with the -g option.<br /><br />If the user is currently a member of a group which is not listed, the user will be removed from the group. This behaviour can be changed via the -a option, which appends the user to the current supplementary group list.<br /><br /><br /><br />
398;;190;What option with usermod changes the username?;-l LOGIN NEW_LOGIN<br /><br /><br />The name of the user will be changed from LOGIN to NEW_LOGIN. Nothing else is changed. In particular, the user's home directory name should probably be changed manually to reflect the new login name.<br /><br />
399;;190;What command option for usermod locks the user account?;-L<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Lock a user's password. This puts a '!' in front of the encrypted password, effectively disabling the password. You can't use this option with -p or -U.
400;;190;What option with usermod set's a user's home directory?;-m <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Move the content of the user's home directory to the new location.<br><br /><br>This option is only valid in combination with the -d (or --home) option.<br><br /><br>The usermod command will try to adapt the ownership of the files and to copy the modes, ACL and extended attributes, but manual changes might be needed afterwards.<br><br />
401;;191;As with the useradd command what must you do with the -p option for adding passwords?;Use the openssl passwd command to encrypt the password also.
402;;191;What does the -s option do for usermod?;-s<br><br /><br>The name of the user's new login shell. Setting this field to blank causes the system to select the default login shell.<br><br />
403;;191;What option with usermod sets the UID for the user?;-u UID<br><br /><br>The new numerical value of the user's ID.<br><br /><br>This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system accounts.<br><br /><br>The user's mailbox, and any files which the user owns and which are located in the user's home directory will have the file user ID changed automatically.<br><br /><br>The ownership of files outside of the user's home directory must be fixed manually.<br><br />
404;;191;How do you unlock a user account with usermod?;-U<br><br /><br>Unlock a user's password. This removes the '!' in front of the encrypted password. You can't use this option with -p or -L.<br><br /><br>Note: if you wish to unlock the account (not only access with a password), you should also set the EXPIRE_DATE (for example to 99999, or to the EXPIRE value from /etc/default/useradd).
405;;191;What option must be given to userdel to remove the users home directory?;userdel -r user_name<br /><br />-r<br /><br />Files in the user's home directory will be removed along with the home directory itself and the user's mail spool. Files located in other file systems will have to be searched for and deleted manually.<br /><br />
406;;191;What are the fields in the /etc/group file?;The /etc/group file contains basic group attributes. This is an ASCII file that contains records for system groups. Each record appears on a single line and is the following format:<br /><br />Name:Password:ID:User1,User2,...,Usern<br /><br />You must separate each attribute with a colon. Records are separated by new-line characters. The attributes in a record have the following values:<br /><br />Name - Specifies a group name that is unique on the system. See the mkgroup command for information on the restrictions for naming groups.<br />Password - Not used. In its place you will fix an &quot x&quot <br />Group ID - The value is a unique decimal integer string. The maximum value is 4,294,967,295 (4 GB).<br />User1,User2,...,Usern<br />	Identifies a list of one or more users. Separate group member names with commas. Each user must already be defined in the local database configuration files.
407;;182;Instead of listing the passsword in the /etc/group file where is the password usually stored?;/etc/gshadow
408;;182;What do the entries represent in the /etc/gshadow file?;Group_name:Password:Group_Admin:Group_members

This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the smallest ID value greater than 999 and&nbsp &nbsp greater than every other group. Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system accounts.<br /><br />
411;;182;As with useradd what must you do with groupadd for the&nbsp &nbsp -p password option?;Encrypt the password first with openssl passwd. 
412;;183;What is the option with groupadd that creates a system group? ;-r<br><br /><br>Create a system group.<br><br />

Any files that have the old group ID and must continue to belong to GROUP, must have their group ID changed manually.<br /><br />-h, --help<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Display help message and exit.<br /><br />-n, --new-name NEW_GROUP<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>The name of the group will be changed from GROUP to NEW_GROUP name.<br /><br />-o, --non-unique<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>When used with the -g option, allow to change the group GID to a non-unique value.<br /><br />-p, --password PASSWORD<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).<br /><br />Note: This option is not recommended because the password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes. You should make sure the password respects the system's password policy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
417;;183;How do you remove a group on the system?;groupdel
418;;72;When in the fdisk command what option displays a lists of available commands?;m
419;;72;In the fdisk command what option will list the partitions?;p
420;;72;Using the fdisk command how can you get a list of partitions?;Red Hat: /sbin/fdisk -l<br /><br /><br />Debian: sudo fdisk -l
421;;72;What is the option in the fdisk command to delete a partition?;d
422;;72;After entering the 'n' option infdisk what is the next thing you should do?;The 'n' option is for the creation of a new partition. You will need to select whetherto create a primary partition or an extended partiton.
423;;72;How many partitions are allowed on any hard disk?;Four which can be either primary or extended partitions. Be aware though within an extended partion you can create many logical partitions. 
424;;72;What is the general rule for creating partitions?;Create your primary partition first. Then make an extended partition and create logical partitions within it. 
425;;82;In fdisk what are the command options for primary and extended partitions?;p - primary<br>e - extended
426;;82;In fdisk how can you specify the size of a partition in GB?;&lt size&gt G
427;;82;In the command fdisk how can you print a list of numerial numbers representing the ID number of the file system type?;At the fdisk prompt type 'l'. This will list numbers along with their corresponding file systems like fat32, FreeBSD, and NTFS.
428;;82;What must you do in fdisk to save the changes made?;Apply the changes with 'w'. If you wish to quit without saving enter 'q'.
429;;82;What command can you use if you want the kernel to recognize changes to partitions without rebooting?;partprobe<br /><br /><br />The command partprobe&nbsp &nbsp is&nbsp &nbsp a&nbsp &nbsp program&nbsp &nbsp that&nbsp &nbsp informs&nbsp &nbsp the operating system kernel of partition table changes, by requesting that the operating system re-read the partition table.<br><br /><br>partprobe -s <br>-s&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Show a summary of devices and their partitions.<br /><br />
430;;82;What are some commands that can be used to format partitions?;mkfs<br />mkreisrfs<br />mkswap
431;;82;What is the default file system for the mkfs command?;ext2
432;;83;What are some of the file system builders mkfs is a front end for?;/sbin/mkfs.minix<br>/sbin/mkfs.ntfs<br>/sbin/mkfs.bfs<br>/sbin/mkfs.ext4<br>/sbin//mkfs.ext3<br>/sbin/mkfs.ext2<br>/sbin/mkfs.vfat<br>/sbin/mkfs.xfs<br>/sbin/mkfs.cramfs<br>/sbin/mkfs.msdos
433;;83;What option is given to the mkfs command to specify a file system?;-t Specify&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp type&nbsp &nbsp of filesystem to be built.<br><br /><br>Example:<br><br /><br>mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
434;;83;The command mkfs uses the -b option to specify the size of the data blocks in the file system. What values are allowed? ;1024, 2048, and 4096
435;;83;What is the general syntax for the mkfs command?;mkfs [options] [-t type fs-options] device [size]<br><br />
436;;83;What are inodes?;An inode is a data structure on a filesystem on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that stores all the information about a file except its name and its actual data. It contains information on size, owner, and permissions. Limiting the amount of inodes on the system will limit how many files can be create.
437;;83;What option with mkfs.ext2 sets the size of the inode?;-i bytes-per-inode<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Specify&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp bytes/inode&nbsp &nbsp ratio.&nbsp &nbsp mke2fs creates an inode for every bytes-per-inode bytes of space on the disk.&nbsp &nbsp The larger the bytes-per-inode ratio, the fewer inodes will&nbsp &nbsp be&nbsp &nbsp created. This value generally shouldn't be smaller than the blocksize of the filesystem, since in that case more inodes would be made than can ever be&nbsp &nbsp used. Be&nbsp &nbsp warned&nbsp &nbsp that&nbsp &nbsp it&nbsp &nbsp is not possible to expand the number of inodes on a filesystem after it is created, so be careful deciding the correct value for this parameter.<br><br />
438;;84;What option for mkfs can be used to add a journal to the file system?;-j&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br /><br />Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal.&nbsp &nbsp If the -j option is not specified, the default&nbsp &nbsp journal&nbsp &nbsp parameters&nbsp &nbsp will&nbsp &nbsp be used to create an appropriately sized journal (given the size of the filesystem) stored within the filesystem.&nbsp &nbsp Note that you must be&nbsp &nbsp using a kernel which has ext3 support in order to actually make use of the journal.
439;;84;By default if you do not specify options for mkfs what will the command try to do?;Create a block size and the number of inodes appropriate for the system. 
440;;84;On a file system what is a superblock?;A superblock is a record of the characteristics of a filesystem, including its size, the block size, the empty and the filled blocks and their respective counts, the size and location of the inode tables, the disk block map and usage information, and the size of the block groups. 
441;;84;What command is used to create a Reiser file system?;mkreiserfs
442;;84;What does the acronym xfs stand for?;Extents File System
443;;84;What command can you run to find out if your Linux kernel supports the xfs file system?;find / -name mkfs.???
444;;84;What is the syntax for creating an xfs file system on /dev/sdb1?;mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1
445;;85;What is the command for creating a swap partition?;mkswap<br /><br />The device argument will usually be a disk partition (something like /dev/sdb7) but can also be a file. <br /><br />After creating the swap area, you need the swapon command to start using it.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Usually swap areas are listed in /etc/fstab so that they can be taken into use at boot time by a swapon -a command in some boot script.<br /><br />
446;;85;How many Linux swap partitions can you create?;There is not a limit. You can have multiple swap partitions.
447;;85;What is Logical Volume Management?;Logical volume management provides a higher-level view of the disk storage on a computer system than the traditional view of disks and partitions.&nbsp &nbsp Storage volumes created under the control of the logical volume manager can be resized and moved around. The logical volume manager also allows management of storage volumes in user-defined groups, allowing the system administrator to deal with sensibly named volume groups such as &quot development&quot . From the volume group you can use Logical Volume Manager to allocate space. Instead of mounting partitions you mount storage volumes. 
448;;85;What are some advantages Logical Volume Management?;1. With logical volume management, the whole disk would be allocated to a single volume group and logical volumes created to hold the /, /usr, and /home file systems. Then if space is low in a certain area it can adjusted in size. <br /><br /><br />2. A logical volume can be extended to a new disk for expanding volumes. <br /><br /><br />3. User groups can be allocated to volume groups and logical volumes and these can be grown as required.
449;;85;What are some of the traditional locations for mounting media?;/mnt<br>/media
450;;85;What is the output if no options are given to the command mount?<br /><br />;The programs mount and umount maintain a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file /etc/mtab. If no arguments are given to mount, this list is printed.<br /><br />
451;;85;Normally,&nbsp &nbsp only&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp superuser can mount filesystems.&nbsp &nbsp However, when what certain file contains the user option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding system?<br /><br />;Given the line in /etc/fstab<br /><br /><br />/dev/cdrom&nbsp &nbsp /cd&nbsp &nbsp iso9660&nbsp &nbsp ro,user,noauto,unhide<br /><br /><br />Any&nbsp &nbsp user&nbsp &nbsp can&nbsp &nbsp mount&nbsp &nbsp the iso9660 filesystem found on his CDROM using the command<br /><br /><br />mount /dev/cdrom<br />or<br />mount /cd<br /><br />
452;;86;What is the syntax for mounting an ISO image for access to files without burning to optical disk?;mount -o loop filename.iso /mount/point

454;;86;What command can be used to display the file system mounts and disk space usage?;df - report file system disk space usage<br><br /><br>If no file name is&nbsp &nbsp given,&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp space&nbsp &nbsp available&nbsp &nbsp on&nbsp &nbsp all&nbsp &nbsp currently mounted&nbsp &nbsp file&nbsp &nbsp systems&nbsp &nbsp is&nbsp &nbsp shown.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.<br><br />
455;;86;What file beside /etc/mtab lists essentially the same output?;/proc/mounts
456;;86;What is the syntax to undo a mount?;As a super user:<br><br /><br>umount /path/to/mount

458;;87;How many fields are in the /etc/fstab listing?;6
459;;87;What is the first collumn in /etc/fstab?;The first field (fs_spec).<br><br /><br>This field describes the block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted.<br><br /><br>Example: /dev/sda1<br><br />
460;;87;What is the second collumn in /etc/fstab?;The second field (fs_file).<br /><br /><br />This field describes the mount point for the filesystem.&nbsp &nbsp For swap partitions, this field should be specified as `none'. If the name of the mount point contains spaces these can be escaped as `\040'.<br /><br />
461;;87;What is the third collumn in /etc/fstab?;The third field (fs_vfstype).<br /><br />This field describes the type of the filesystem.&nbsp &nbsp Linux supports lots of filesystem types. For the filesystems currently supported by the running kernel, see /proc/filesystems.<br /><br />
462;;87;What is the fourth collumn in /etc/fstab?;The fourth field (fs_mntops).<br /><br />This field describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.<br /><br />It is formatted&nbsp &nbsp as&nbsp &nbsp a comma separated list of options.&nbsp &nbsp It contains at least the type of mount plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type. <br /><br />Basic file system independent options are:<br /><br />defaults - use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.<br /><br />noauto - do not mount when &quot mount -a&quot  is given (e.g., at boot time)<br /><br />user - allow a user to mount<br /><br />owner - allow device owner to mount<br /><br />comment - for use by fstab-maintaining programs<br /><br />nofail - do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.<br /><br />rw - read/write, ro- read/only<br /><br />sync - Enables synchromous I/O. Changes are written immediately which is usually for removable devices like floppy drives. <br /><br />async - Enalbes asynchromous I/O. Changes are cached and then written when the system isn't busy. This is typically for hard drives. <br /><br /><br /><br />
463;;87;What is the fifth collumn in /etc/fstab?;The fifth field (fs_freq).<br /><br /><br />This&nbsp &nbsp field is used for these filesystems by the dump(8) command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped. If the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is returned and dump will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.<br /><br />
464;;88;What is the sixth column in /etc/fstab?;The sixth field (fs_passno).<br /><br /><br />This&nbsp &nbsp field&nbsp &nbsp is&nbsp &nbsp used by the fsck program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time.&nbsp &nbsp The root filesystem should be specified with a fs_passno of 1, and other filesystems&nbsp &nbsp should have&nbsp &nbsp a&nbsp &nbsp fs_passno of 2.&nbsp &nbsp Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially, but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware.&nbsp &nbsp If the sixth field is not present or zero, a value of zero is returned and fsck will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.<br /><br />
465;;88;What are the two main commands used to track disk space?;df - report file system disk space usage<br><br /><br>du - estimate file space usage<br><br />
466;;88;What will the command 'df filename' output?;It will display information about the partition the specified file resides on.

483;;73;What administrative tool is the equivalent of tune2fs for the XFS file system?;xfs_admin<br /><br /><br />xfs_admin uses the xfs_db command to modify various parameters of a filesystem. Devices&nbsp &nbsp that&nbsp &nbsp are&nbsp &nbsp mounted cannot be modified.<br /><br /><br />-e&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enables&nbsp &nbsp unwritten extent support on a filesystem that does not already have this enabled (for legacy&nbsp &nbsp filesystems, it can't be disabled anymore at mkfs time).<br /><br /><br />-j&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enables version 2 log format (journal format supporting larger log buffers).<br /><br>-l&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Print the current filesystem label.<br><br /><br>-L label&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sets the file system's label.<br><br /><br>-U uuid&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sets the UUID of the file system. <br><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
484;;74;The xfs_info command displays information about the xfs file system. What other command with options will display the same information?;xfs_info is equivalent to invoking xfs_growfs with the -n option.<br><br /><br>-n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Specifies&nbsp &nbsp that&nbsp &nbsp no&nbsp &nbsp change to the filesystem is to be made.&nbsp &nbsp The filesystem geometry is printed, and argument checking is performed, but no growth occurs.
485;;74;What command dumps xfs file system metadata such as file names and files sizes to a file?;xfs_metadump<br><br /><br>xfs_metadump is a debugging tool that copies the metadata from an XFS filesystem to a file. xfs_metadump should only be used to copy unmounted filesystems, read-only mounted filesystems, or frozen filesystems<br><br />
486;;74;What command can be used to display a list of open files belonging to all active process on the system?;lsof<br /><br />In the absence of any options, lsof lists all open files belonging to all active processes.<br /><br />-s&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This option alone directs lsof to display file size at all times.&nbsp &nbsp It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE.&nbsp &nbsp If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.<br /><br />-t&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This option specifies that lsof should produce terse output with process identifiers only and no header - e.g., so that the output may be piped to kill.<br /><br />-u user_name&nbsp &nbsp Displays only openfiles associated with the specified user.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
487;;74;What command&nbsp &nbsp displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems?;The fuser command displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems.&nbsp &nbsp In the default display mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:<br><br /><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp c&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp current directory.<br><br /><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp e&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp executable being run.<br><br /><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp f&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp open file. f is omitted in default display mode.<br><br /><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp F&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp open file for writing.

496;;75;What is a common program for automounting?;The autofs is a program for automatically mounting directories on an as-needed basis. Auto-mounts are mounted only as they are accessed, and are unmounted after a period of inactivity. The master configuration file for autofs is /etc/auto.master by default.
497;;76;What is the syntax for mounting an optical drive?;mount -t iso 9660<br><br /><br>Example: mount -t iso 9660 /dev/cdrom /media/dvd

500;;76;With USB or Firewire devices how are they treated and where are they usually address for mounting?;Most distributions treat them as SCSI devices. They are addressed through <br><br /><br>/dev/sdx<br><br /><br>The value of x depends on the amount of hard drives installed on the system. 
501;;76;What file is useful to run 'tail -f' on to check where your system automounts a USB drive?;Most distributions this can be:<br><br /><br>tail -f /var/log/messages<br><br /><br>For Ubuntu since version 11.04 this is <br><br /><br>tail -f /var/log/syslog
502;;76;Sometimes in mounting USB or Firewire drives you do not know the file system type. What option can you use with mount to try to get around this?;-t auto<br /><br />This will cause the mount command to try to detect what file system has been used on the device. <br /><br /><br />Example: mount -t auto /dev/sdd /media/thumbdrive
503;;76;What are six separate command line tools for renaming partitions?;What tool to use depends on the file system:<br /><br />1. For FAT16 and FAT32 partitions, use mlabel from the mtools package.<br /><br />2. For NTFS partitions, use ntfslabel from the ntfs-3g package.<br /><br />3. For ext2, ext3, or ext4 partitions, use e2label.<br /><br />4. For JFS partitions, use jfs_tune.<br /><br />5. For ReiserFS (v3) partitions, use reiserfstune.<br /><br />6. For XFS partitions, use xfs_admin

505;;77;To see information about currently mounted systems, simply run what command?;mount
506;;77;What are the most common backup types?;Full:<br><br /><br>All files are backed up regardless if they have been modified since the last backup. Each file is flagged after it has been backed up. <br><br /><br>Incremental:<br><br /><br>Only the files that have been modified since the last back, either full or incremental, are backed up. Each file is flagged after it has been backed up.<br><br /><br>Differential:<br><br /><br>Only the files that have been modified since the last full backup are backed up, but the files are not flagged as having been backed up. <br><br /><br><br />
507;;77;If you are not going to backup the whole system what directories should you consider backing up?;/etc<br>/home<br>/opt<br>/root<br>/var<br>/srv
508;;77;What does the acronym tar stand for?;tape archive
509;;77;What does a tarball consist of?;First all the files are copied to a single archive file  the tar file. The .tar file is then compressed with the gzip utility. The resulting file has an extension .tar.gz.

520;;79;What command with the tar command causes it to exclude the file listed?;-X filename<br>--exclude-from
521;;79;What is the main difference between cpio command and the tar command?;The cpio command needs a list of file and directories to backup from standard input.
522;;79;If there are no subdirectories in the folder you are using the cpio command for what is the syntax?;ls | cpio -ov &gt  /path/to/file.cpio
523;;79;What option with the cpio command tells it to create a new archive?;-o
524;;79;What does the cpio command acronym stand for?;copy in, copy out
525;;80;What is the syntax for the cpio command if there are directories in the location to copy?;You need to change directory to the location to be saved, then run:<br><br /><br>find . -print -depth } cpio -ov /path/to/backup.cpio
526;;80;What is an example syntax for extracting a cpio archive file?;mkdir output<br /><br />cd output<br /><br />cpio -iv &lt  /tmp/object.cpio
527;;80;What is the option for the cpio command to extract the file?;-i
528;;80;Give an example of the cpio command that adds gzip utility to the pipe?;ls | cpio -ov | gzip &gt  /media/usb/backup.cpio.gz
529;;80;Using the standard out option for gunzip extract a backup.cpio.gz file.;The standard out option for gunzip is -c. <br /><br /><br />Example: gunzip -c backup.cpio.gz | cpio -i
530;;80;What is the primary difference between the cp command and the dd command?;The dd command uses records with the default size being 512 bytes.
531;;80;What is the simplified syntax of the dd command?;dd if=input_file of=output_file
532;;81;What are some of the byte options for the dd command?;`ibs=BYTES'<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the input block size to BYTES.&nbsp &nbsp This makes `dd' read BYTES per<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp block.&nbsp &nbsp The default is 512 bytes.<br><br /><br>`obs=BYTES'<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the output block size to BYTES.&nbsp &nbsp This makes `dd' write BYTES<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp per block.&nbsp &nbsp The default is 512 bytes.<br><br /><br>`bs=BYTES'<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set both input and output block sizes to BYTES.&nbsp &nbsp This makes `dd'<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp read and write BYTES per block, overriding any `ibs' and `obs'<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp settings.&nbsp &nbsp In addition, if no data-transforming `conv' option is<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp specified, input is copied to the output as soon as it's read,<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp even if it is smaller than the block size.<br><br /><br>`cbs=BYTES'<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the conversion block size to BYTES.&nbsp &nbsp When converting<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp variable-length records to fixed-length ones (`conv=block') or the<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp reverse (`conv=unblock'), use BYTES as the fixed record length.<br><br />
533;;81;Using the dd command fill the secure.bin file with 1 MB of random bits.;dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=1000 of=secure.bin<br /><br /><br />The block size has been set to 1024 bytes and this write 1000 random bits using the kernel built-in random byte generator of urandom.<br /><br />
534;;81;What is the syntax for the dd command to make an ISO file from a CD?;dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/path/to/backup.iso bs=2048 conv=sync<br><br /><br>The 'if' specifies the input file. The 'of' specifies the output file. <br><br /><br>bs is “block size”, in this case 2048 bytes per block<br><br /><br>conv is for conversion, in this case we are using “sync” which tells DD to execute synchronized input and output, this is needed for the CD-ROM as we want to read a whole block to ensure no data loss occurs.
535;;81;What is the syntax with the dd command to copy the sda2 partition to the sdb2 partition.;dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sdb2 bs=4096 conv=noerror
536;;81;Use the dd command to copy the entire master boot partition including the partion table.&nbsp &nbsp ;dd if=/dev/sda of=MBR.img bs=512 count=1
537;;81;Use the dd command to create an image file from a partition.;dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=partition.image bs=4096 conv=noerror
538;;97;What are the ways in which the chown command syntax is used?;If only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that&nbsp &nbsp user&nbsp &nbsp is&nbsp &nbsp made&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp owner&nbsp &nbsp of&nbsp &nbsp each&nbsp &nbsp given file, and the files' group is not changed. If the owner is followed by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership of the files&nbsp &nbsp is changed as well.&nbsp &nbsp If a colon but no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to that user's login group. If&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp colon and&nbsp &nbsp group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed  in this case, chown performs the same function as chgrp.
539;;97;Break down the numbers used in octal numeric permissions.;rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111<br />rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110<br />rwx --- --- = 111 000 000<br /><br /><br />rwx = 111 in binary = 7<br />rw- = 110 in binary = 6<br />r-x = 101 in binary = 5<br />r-- = 100 in binary = 4
540;;97;The chown command is used to change the user or group ownership. What is the general syntax for this command?;chown user.group file_or_directory
541;;97;What option with the chown command allows the change of ownership recursively?;-R, --recursive<br><br /><br>operate on files and directories recursively<br><br />
542;;97;What does this command string do? <br /><br /><br />chgrp new_group /home/user/myfile.txt;The chgrp command changes group ownership. This command changes the group ownership of the myfile.txt file to the group called new_group. <br /><br /><br /><br />
543;;97;What option with the chgrp command allows the changing of group ownership recursively?;-R, --recursive<br><br /><br>operate on files and directories recursively<br><br />
544;;98;What are the symbols rwx affect on files? ;r - Read - The read permission allows a user to open and view a file. It does not allow the uer to modify or save the file. <br /><br /><br />w - Write - The write permission allows the user to open, modify, and save a file. <br /><br /><br />x - Execute - The execute permission allows a user to run the program (execute).
545;;98;What are the symbols rwx affect on permissions for directories?;r - Read - The read permission allows a user to list the contents of a directory. <br><br /><br>w - Write - The write permission allows a user to add or delete files from the directory.<br><br /><br>x - Execute - The execute permission grants the ability to access file contents and metainfo if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory (unless read is set).
546;;98;Permissions are assigned to what three different entities?;1. Owner - The user account that has been assigned to be the file or directory's owner. These permissions apply only to that user account. <br /><br /><br />2. Group - This group has been assigned ownership fo the file or directory. These permission are assigned to the group and only apply to users who are members of the group. <br /><br /><br />3. Others - This refers to all other who have authenticated to the system . Permissions assigned here apply to these user accounts not in the group.&nbsp &nbsp <br /><br /><br />You may find another entity often abbreviated as 'a'. This is a reference to all as in 'ugo' (user, group, others).
547;;98;When using the ls -l command before the permissions listing is - or d. What do these stand for? <br /><br /><br />Example: -rwxr-xr-x;- The dash stands for a file.<br /><br /><br />d The lower case d stands for a directory.
548;;98;What are the place holders in a permissions list?<br><br /><br>Example: rwxrwx--x;The first three are for the owner.<br><br /><br>The second three are for the group. <br><br /><br>The third three are for others. 
549;;99;What is the general syntax for the chmod command?;chmod who=permissions filename<br /><br /><br />The&nbsp &nbsp format&nbsp &nbsp of&nbsp &nbsp a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.&nbsp &nbsp Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.<br /><br /><br />A combination of the letters 'ugoa' controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users&nbsp &nbsp (a). If none&nbsp &nbsp of&nbsp &nbsp these&nbsp &nbsp are&nbsp &nbsp given,&nbsp &nbsp the&nbsp &nbsp effect is as if 'a' were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.<br /><br /><br />The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file  - causes&nbsp &nbsp them&nbsp &nbsp to&nbsp &nbsp be&nbsp &nbsp removed  and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.<br /><br />
550;;99;Turn on the execute permissions for the current user using chmod on the file program.sh.;chmod u+x program.sh
551;;99;Without the umask operation what are the global rights to Linux files and directories?;rw-rw-rw- (666) for every file<br><br /><br>rwxrwxrwx (777) for every directory
552;;99;The umask operation modifes the default permissions by doing what?;Subtracting from the default file and directory permissions. 
553;;99;What does umask stand for?;user mask
554;;99;At the beginning of a listing from the ls -l command file system objects are listed by the first character. What are the meanings?;- Regular file<br>d Directory<br>l Symbolic link<br>c Character special device<br>b Block special device<br>p FIFO<br>s Socket<br><br />
555;;181;What command displays the groups you are part of?;groups
556;;181;What command prints both user and group information?;id
557;;100;What do the postitions in the octal numbers define?;Octal notation consists of a three- or four-digit base-8 value. <br><br /><br>With three-digit octal notation, each numeral represents a different component of the permission set: user class, group class, and &quot others&quot  class respectively.<br><br /><br>First postion: user<br>Second position: group<br>Third position: others
558;;100;What import system action happens when a user starts a program?;The programs you start inherit your user id so they cannot access any filesystem objects for which you haven't been granted access.<br><br />
559;;100;The Linux permission model has two special access modes. What are they?;suid - set user id - When an executable file has been given the suid attribute, normal users on the system who have permission to execute this file gain the privileges of the user who owns the file (commonly root) within the created process. When root privileges have been gained within the process, the application can then perform tasks on the system that regular users normally would be restricted from doing.<br><br /><br>sgid - set group id - The sgid attribute will allow for changing the group-based privileges within a process, like the setuid flag does for user-based privileges.
560;;100;What part of the output ls -l command indicates a program has the suid set?;The symbol 's' stands for the suid being set in a program.<br /><br /><br />Example: ls -l /usr/bin/passwd<br />-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 42824 Apr&nbsp &nbsp 8 19:32 /usr/bin/passwd<br><br /><br>The 's' takes the place of the 'x' bit.<br /><br />
561;;100;If a file has a sgid or suid set in its permissions how will the permissions be displayed in the ls -l command?;The suid and sgid bits occupy the same space as the x bits for user and group in a long directory listing. If the file is executable, the suid or sgid bits, if set, will be displayed as lowercase s, otherwise they are displayed as uppercase S.<br /><br /><br />The suid and sgid bits are set and reset symbolically using the letter s  for example, u+s sets the suid access mode, and g-s removes the sgid mode. In the octal format, suid has the value 4 in the first (high order) digit, while sgid has the value 2.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
562;;29;What option with the ls command list directories instead of files?;-d<br><br /><br>list directory entries instead of contents, and do not dereference symbolic links<br><br /><br><br />
563;;101;What is the sticky bit and what does it do?;The sticky bit sets permissions only on a directory. In Linux it can not be used on files. If you set the sticky bit to a directory, other users cannot delete or rename the files (or subdirectories) within that directory. It is represented symbolically by 't' and numerically as a 1 in the high-order octal digit.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />chmod +t /path/to/directory<br />chmod 1777 /path/to/directory<br /><br /><br />Often it is a good idea to set the sticky bit on public directories.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
564;;101;Summarize the symbolic and octal permission setting on access modes for sgid, suid and the sticky bit.;Access Mode&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Symbolic&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Octal <br />suid&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp s with u&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 4000<br />sgid&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp s with g&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2000<br />sticky&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp t&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1000<br /><br />
565;;101;The ls command displays permissions in the symbolic format and not the octal format. What command can you use to display permissions in the octal format? ;find&nbsp &nbsp %m
566;;101;What is the immutable attribute flag and how do you list and set it?;The immutable flag sets the file for no deletion even by root. Use the command 'lsattr' to see the permissions and the command 'chattr -i' to set the immutable flag.
567;;101;What does the umask specify?;The umask specifies which permissions should not be granted. It is a subtraction from the default file permission of 777 and folder permission of 666.&nbsp &nbsp <br><br />
568;;102;How can you temporarily change the default permissions on file and directory creation?;umask &lt value&gt <br><br /><br>Typically the value is three digits from 000 to 777. 
569;;102;If you need to change the umask value and make it persistent what should you do?;Depending on the distribution you wil modify one of these files:<br><br /><br>/etc/profile<br>/etc/login.defs
570;;102;What is the SUID?;Set User ID<br /><br /><br />If the SUID bit is set for any application then your user ID would be set as that of the owner of application/file rather than the current user while running that application. It applies to binary executables. It has no affect on directories.
571;;102;What is the SGID?;Set group ID<br><br /><br>When the SGID bit is set the user will run with the same rights as the group specified. This can be applied to binary executable files or directories.&nbsp &nbsp For directories it also may mean that when a new file is created in the directory it will inherit the group of the directory instead the user who created the file.
572;;102;Special permissions are referenced as an extra digit added to the beginning of the file or directories mode. What are their numerical values?;SUID 4<br />SGID 2<br />Sticky Bit 1
573;;103;What are Linux quotas for?;Quotas affect two areas of disk usage. The first is the number of inodes a user or group can possess. The second is the number of disk blocks that can be provided a user or group.
574;;103;What kernel version supported disk quotas?;Disk quotas are support in kernel verions 2.4 and beyond.
575;;103;What are the two general ways depending on distribution of finding out if the qouta command is installed on the system?;RPM Based: rpm -q qouta<br><br /><br>Debian Based: dpkg -l qouta
576;;103;To enabled qoutas for use on a Linux system what file must you modify first?;/etc/fstab<br><br /><br>The fourth field describes the mount options associated with the filesystem. You need to add usrquota and/or grpquota.
577;;103;After you have installed quota and modified the /etc/fstab file what must you do for your changes to take affect?;Remount the file system or restart the system.
578;;104;User quota information and group quota information are stored where?;The user quota information is stored in the aquota.user file in the root of the<br>filesystem, and group quota is similarly stored in aquota.group.<br><br />
579;;104;What command creates the required aquota.user and aquota.group files if they do not exist?<br><br />;The command quotacheck checks for the aquota.user file and aqouta.group file and creates them if they do not exist. This command is also used to repair those files. 
580;;104;What are some of the common command options for the quotacheck command?;-a, --all<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in /etc/mtab <br /><br>-c or --create-files<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ignore existing quota files. Run a new scan and write the results to disk<br><br /><br />-M, --try-remount<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This flag forces checking of filesystem in read-write mode if a remount fails.<br /><br /><br />-u, --user<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only user quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified are to be checked. This is the default action.<br /><br /><br />-g, --group<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only group quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified are to be checked. <br /><br /><br />-v verbose mode
581;;104;What command turns on and off file system quotas?;quotaon <br>quotaoff<br><br /><br>The quotaon command announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one or more filesystems. The filesystem quota files must be present in the root directory of the specified filesystem and be named either aquota.user or aquota.group<br><br /><br>The quotaoff command announces to the system that the specified filesystems should have any disk quotas turned off. 
582;;104;What are some common options for the quotaon and quotaoff commands?;-a, --all<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Force all filesystems in /etc/fstab to have their quotas enabled or disabled.<br /><br />-u, --user<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Manipulate user quotas. This is the default.<br /> <br />-g, --group<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Manipulate group quotas. <br /><br />-v, --verbose<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Display a message for each filesystem affected. 
583;;105;What command can be used with quotas to show a summary quotas for a file system?;repquota -av<br><br /><br>-a&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Print the quotas of all the file systems listed in /etc/fstab.<br><br /><br>-g&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Print only group quotas (the default is to print both group and<br>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp user quotas if they exist).<br><br /><br>-u&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Print only user quotas (the default is to print both group and<br>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp user quotas if they exist).<br><br /><br>-v&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Print a header line before printing each file system quotas."
584;;105;What command is used to edit user and group quotas?;edquota -u user_name' or 'edquota -g group_name'<br /><br />Some of the common options are:<br /><br />-f, --filesystem<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Perform specified operations only for given filesystem (default is to perform operations for all filesystems with quota). <br /><br />-t, --edit-period<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Edit the soft time limits for each filesystem. Time units of 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', and 'days' are understood. <br /><br />-T, --edit-times<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Edit time for the user/group when softlimit is enforced. Possible values are 'unset' or number and unit. Units are the same as in -t option. 
585;;105;What is the default editor on running the edquota command?;vi
586;;105;What is the syntax with the edquota command to copy quota settings to another user?;edquota -p source_user destination_user1 destination_user2.....
587;;42;What are some common IRQ channels?;IRQ 0 System Timer<br />IRQ 1 Keyboard<br />IRQ 3 COM 2<br />IRQ 4 COM 1<br />IRQ 5 LPT 2<br />IRQ 6 Floppy Drive<br />IRQ 7 LPT 1<br />IRQ 8 Real Time Clock<br /><br /><br />Interrupts 0, 1, and 8 are hard wired and can not be used for any other device on the system. 
588;;42;The moderm programmable interrupt controller has 16 interrupts. How does it do this?;Early PCs had only eight interrupts and a single PIC. To get 16 two PIC chips are cascaded together. The second interrupt wire on the second PIC is wired into INT 2. Therefore it is said INT 2 and INT 9 are the same.
589;;42;The I/O addresses are used to communicate between devices through the CPU. How many are there and how are they notated?;65,535<br><br /><br>They are notated in hexidecimal.<br><br /><br>All devices must have a unique I/O address assigned. Many devices will use a range of I/O addresses.
590;;42;What are some common I/O address assignments?;00 – 1F First DMA controller<br>40 – 5F Programmable Interval Timer/System Timer<br>60 – 6F Keyboard<br>70 - 7F Real Time Clock<br>1F0 – 1F7 Primary ATA Hard Disk Controller<br>2F8 – 2FF COM 2 Serial Port<br>3F8 – 3FF COM 1 Serial Port
591;;42;What are dierct memory access channels?;A DMA channel is used for high-throughput device to communicate directly with RAM without involving the CPU. This could be used for sound boards, floppy disk drives, and some hard drives. Moderm DMA controllers cascade two DMA controller chips to get 8 DMA channels. Because of this DMA channels 0 and 4 are the same DMA channel.
592;;42;PnP requires what three components?;A PnP compatible BIOS.<br><br /><br>A PnP compatible device.<br><br /><br>A PnP compatible operating system.
593;;43;In what directory are the kernel module drivers usually stored?;/lib/modules/&lt kernel_version&gt /kernel/drivers
594;;43;What are the two different ways to implement device drivers?;1. They can be loaded as a kernel modules.<br /><br /><br />2. Compile the driver within the kernel itself. This requires recompiling your kernel from its source code and inputting the hardware support needed directly within the kernel.
595;;43;What is a general good rule for compiling kernel drivers?;Only compile those drivers the system needs to boot up. The rest load as kernel modules.
596;;43;What file contains details about the CPU?;/proc/cpuinfo
597;;43;What file contains a list of devices installed in the system?;/proc/devices
598;;43;What file contains a list of dma channel assignments on the system?;/proc/dma
599;;44;What file contains a list of IRQ assignements on the system?;/proc/interrupts
600;;44;What file contains a list of I/O port assignements?;/proc/iomem
601;;44;What file contains a list of the kernel modules actively being used by the system?;/proc/modules
602;;44;What live file contains information about the version of the Linux kernel runnong on the machine?;/proc/version
603;;44;What file contains list information about the USB devices in use on the system?;/proc/bus/devices
604;;44;What live file contains information about the SCSI devices in use on the system?;/proc/scsi
605;;45;What live directory contains information about the IDE devices on the system?;/proc/ide
606;;45;What directory and subdirectories contain symbolic link files for each block device on the system?;/sys/block
607;;45;What directory contains a directory for each data bus in the system like the ISA, PCI, SCSI, and USB busses?;/sys/bus<br><br /><br>This contains two subdirectories of devices and drivers.
608;;45;What directory contains all the device classes available?;/sys/class
609;;45;What directory contains a list for every device discovered?;/sys/devices
610;;45;What directory contains subdirectories for each kernel module loaded into the kernel?;/sys/module
611;;46;What command is intended for displaying information about your hard drive?;hdparm /dev/device<br /><br /><br /><br />
612;;46;What command can be used to list all the devices connected to the SCSI controller?;sg_scan<br /><br /><br />If no device names are given, sg_scan does a scan of the sg devices and outputs a line of information for each sg device that is currently bound to a SCSI device. If one or more devices are given only those devices are scanned.<br /><br /><br />The command &quot sginfo -l&quot  will also display a list of all connected SCSI devices.
613;;46;What command can be used to probe for hardware present on the system and is often used system overview log for support? ;hwinfo
614;;46;What command is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the system and devices connected to them?;lspci<br><br /><br>If you would like to see a list of kernel modules associated with each device run with this option: lspci -k
615;;46;What command can be used to view all the currently loaded kernel modules?;lsmod<br><br /><br>The lsmod command pulls information from the /proc/modules file. 
616;;46;What is the typical way to view information about a particular loaded kernel module?;1. Use the lsmod command to find the man of the module in question. <br><br /><br>2. Then enter modinfo module_name.
617;;47;What option with the modinfo command can be used to get module information other than the running kernel?;-k kernel_version<br /><br /><br />Provide information about a kernel other than the running one. This is particularly useful for distributions needing to extract information from a newly installed (but not yet running)set of kernel modules. For example,&nbsp &nbsp you wish to find which firmware files are needed by various modules in a new kernel for which you must make an initrd/initramfs image prior to booting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
618;;47;To load a kernel module what command first creates a file in /lib/modules/kernel_version/?;depmod<br /><br />Linux kernel modules can provide services (called &quot symbols&quot ) for other modules to use (using one of the&nbsp &nbsp EXPORT_SYMBOL variants&nbsp &nbsp in&nbsp &nbsp the code). If a second module uses this symbol, that second module clearly depends on the first module. These dependencies can get quite complex. The depmod commands creates a list of module dependencies by reading each module under /lib/modules/version&nbsp &nbsp and&nbsp &nbsp determining&nbsp &nbsp what symbols it exports and what symbols it needs.&nbsp &nbsp By default, this list is written to modules.dep, and a binary hashed version named modules.dep.bin, in the same directory.
619;;47;After the modules.dep file is created what two commands can be used to load the kernel modules?;1. insmod /lib/modules/kernel_version/kernel/&lt path to .ko file&gt <br /><br /><br />2. modprobe module_name<br /><br /><br />It is preferred to use the modprobe command as insmod command does not take into account the module dependencies provided by depmod.
620;;47;What will the command &quot modprobe -l&quot  do?;List all availabe kernel modules.
621;;47;What does modprobe expect to function properly?;The modprobe command expects&nbsp &nbsp an up-to-date modules.dep.bin file (or fallback human readable modules.dep file), as generated by the corresponding depmod utility shipped along with modprobe.&nbsp &nbsp This file lists what other modules each module needs (if any), and modprobe uses this to add or remove these dependencies automatically.<br><br />
622;;47;What command option with modprobe removes the kernel module?;-r<br><br /><br>This option causes modprobe to remove rather than insert a module. If the modules it depends on are also unused, modprobe will try to remove them too. Unlike insertion, more than one module can be specified on the command line.
623;;48;Modprobe is run at kernel startup. What directory can it query to determine which kernel modules should be loaded at startup?;If the /etc/modprobe.conf file is not present then modprobe will use the files in the /etc/modprobe.d directory to determine what is loaded on boot. 
624;;48;What are some commmon conf files located in Ubuntu's /etc/modprobe.d directory?;alsa-base.conf&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>blacklist-firewire.conf&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>blacklist-oss.conf&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>dkms.conf<br>blacklist-ath_pci.conf&nbsp &nbsp <br>blacklist-framebuffer.conf&nbsp &nbsp <br>blacklist-rare-network.conf&nbsp &nbsp <br>vmwgfx-fbdev.conf<br>blacklist.conf&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>blacklist-modem.conf&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>blacklist-watchdog.conf<br><br />
625;;12;What are '\' and '#' used for in configuration files?;All empty lines, and all text on a line after a ’#’, will be ignored.<br>Lines may be continued by ending the line with a ’\’.
626;;48;What directive in the modprobe.conf file or modprobe.d directories can load and alternatively run a shell command?;install module_name command<br><br /><br>This&nbsp &nbsp command&nbsp &nbsp instructs modprobe to run your command instead of inserting the module in the kernel as normal.&nbsp &nbsp The command can be any shell command: this allows you to do any kind of complex processing you&nbsp &nbsp might&nbsp &nbsp wish. For example, if the module&nbsp &nbsp &quot fred&quot &nbsp &nbsp works better with the module &quot barney&quot  already installed (but it doesn't depend on&nbsp &nbsp it,&nbsp &nbsp so&nbsp &nbsp modprobe&nbsp &nbsp won't automatically&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp load&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp it),&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp you&nbsp &nbsp could&nbsp &nbsp say&nbsp &nbsp &quot install&nbsp &nbsp fred&nbsp &nbsp /sbin/modprobe barney  /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install fred&quot , which would do what you wanted.
627;;48;What directive in the modprobe.conf file or modprobe.d directories allows you to give alternate names for a module?;alias alias_name module_name<br><br /><br><br />
628;;49;What directive in modprobe.conf file or modeprobe.d directoires instructs to ignore the module?;blacklist module_name<br><br /><br><br />

630;;49;What command will remove a module from the kernel modules?;rmmod module_name<br><br /><br>It will not run if the module is in use and does not take into account module depenencies. To check for dependencies on removal use 'modprobe -r module_name' instead.
631;;49;What components assist in the handling of hot swapable devices?;1. sysfs - This is a virtual file system used to export information about about system hardware devices. <br><br /><br>2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) - This daemon runs at startup and provides applications running with information about the hardware available. <br><br /><br>3. Desktop Bus (dbus) - This daemon notifies the running processes when a device is connected or disconnected. <br><br /><br>4. udev - The udev daemon creates a virtual file system that is mounted at /dev. Through the uevent interface it communicates with the kernel. The process for udev is:<br><br /><br>- Initilize the device.<br>- Create device file in /dev directory.<br>- The ifup utility is used if it is a networking device. <br>- It mounts it using information from /etc/fstab if it is a storage device. <br>- It informs running processes about the new device.
632;;116;What are the major categories for system processes (programs)?;Binary executables<br /><br />These are programs originally created using a programing language such as C or C++. The raw program text file is run through a compiler to create a binary file that can run on the system. <br /><br />Internal Shell Commands<br /><br />These are commands that run as part of the shell itself. <br /><br />Shell Scripts<br /><br />These are text files that are executed through the shell itself.&nbsp &nbsp 
633;;116;When you run a command or program through the shell or graphical interface what type of process is this?;Processes started by the user are 'user processes'. They are associated to the shell for that session. 
634;;116;If a process is running but it has not been started by the user specifically what type of process can this be considered?;They are most likely system processes providing system services. They run in the background and usually do not have an apparent user interface. 
635;;116;When a process is created on a Linux system it is assigned what two numbers?;1. Process ID (PID) number<br><br /><br>This is a unique number assigned to a process on the system. <br><br /><br>2. Parent Process ID (PPID)<br><br /><br>This is the PID of the process's parent process.

GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
645;;122;What option with the ps command displays all running process in the BSD style?;ps aux<br><br /><br><br />
646;;122;What are all the fields displayed in the &quot ps aux&quot  command process output?;The &quot ps aux&quot  command lists these fields:<br><br /><br>USER - The user who owns the process. <br>PID - Process ID. <br>%CPU - CPU utilization of the process in &quot ##.#&quot  format.<br>%MEM - The ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.<br>VSZ - The virtual memory size of the process in KiB (1024-byte units).<br>RSS - The resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in kiloBytes).<br>TTY - Controling terminal (tty).<br>STAT - A coded multi-character process state. See section PROCESS STATE CODES for the different values meaning.<br>START - The time the command started. <br>TIME - The accumulated cpu time, user + system. The display format is usually &quot MMM:SS&quot . <br>COMMAND - The name of the command. 
647;;123;With the ps -e output what does &quot ?&quot  mean in the TTY field?;The question mark indicates the process is a system process.

651;;124;What is the syntax for the nice command?;nice -n nice_level command<br><br /><br>Nice can not be run on an active process. For active processes use the renice command.
652;;124;By default what values can not be set through the nice command?;No value of less then 0 is allowed unless you are logged in as root. 
653;;124;What is the syntax for changing a processes nice value while it is running?;For active processes you must use the renice command. The syntax is:<br /><br /><br />renice nice_value PID<br><br /><br>You must be logged in as root to change nice values below zero.
654;;124;What is the difference between a process running in the foreground and a process running the background?;A foreground process is launched from the shell and locks the shell until that process is complete. This is the default behavior of all commands entered from the shell.<br><br /><br>A background process will launch the program and return immediately to the active shell. 
655;;124;What is the syntax for running a command in the background from the shell?;command_name_and_options &amp <br><br /><br>When you append the &quot &amp &quot  to a command it tells the shell to run the command and return control back to the shell.

659;;125;What is one option to leave the vi editor and end its process?;Press esc to make sure you are in command mode, then<br><br /><br>:exit
660;;125;What is the syntax for the kill command?;kill -signal PID
661;;125;What are some of the more useful signals for the kill command?;SIGHUP - This is kill signal 1 and will restart the process. After the restart the process will have the same PID. <br /><br /><br />SIGINT - This is kill signal 2 which sends a CTRL-C key to the process.<br /><br /><br />SIGKILL - This is kill signal 9 which is a brute force signal to kill the process. The resources for this process may remain until a reboot.<br /><br /><br />SIGTERM - This is kill signal 15 which tells the process to terminate immediately. This is the default for the kill command and allow the process to clean itself before exiting. 
662;;125;When specifying the signal for the kill what are the options?;The text like &quot -SIGTERM&quot  or the number like &quot -15&quot  and the process ID.<br><br /><br>Example: kill -15 8210

671;;126;What are some of the time input options for the at command to run other commands?;It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)&nbsp &nbsp You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the&nbsp &nbsp form&nbsp &nbsp month-name&nbsp &nbsp day&nbsp &nbsp with&nbsp &nbsp an&nbsp &nbsp optional&nbsp &nbsp year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The optional 'CC' specifies century which are the first two digits of the year. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of&nbsp &nbsp day. You also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.<br><br />
672;;127;What is the general syntax of the 'at' command?;1. at &lt time&gt  <br><br /><br>2. This brings you to the at&gt  prompt.<br><br /><br>3. At the at&gt  prompt enter the command or commands to execute. Each command will have their own line. <br><br /><br>4. When finished pres CTRL-D. You can then verify the command are scheduled with the 'jobs' command. 
673;;127;What command outputs the commands scheduled in the at command queue?;atq<br /><br /><br />This lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser  in&nbsp &nbsp that&nbsp &nbsp case,&nbsp &nbsp everybody's jobs are listed.

The first word of the line is assigned to the first name, NAME1, the second word to the second name, and so on, with leftover words and their intervening separators assigned to the last name, NAMEN. If there are fewer words read from the input stream than there are names, the remaining names are assigned empty values.<br><br /><br><br />
697;;137;A variable has a value and zero or more attributes. What bash builtin command can be used to assign attributes to a variable?;Attributes are assigned using the declare builtin command. <br /><br />This is sometimes needed as bash by default will consider all variables text.<br /><br />Syntax: declare [-afFirtx] [-p] [name[=value]]<br /><br />-a&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Each name is an array variable.<br />-f&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Use function names only.<br />-i&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The variable is treated as an integer  arithmetic evaluation is performed when the variable is assigned a value.<br />-r&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Make names readonly
698;;137;What entry at the start of a script tells your system that this file is a set of commands to be fed to the command interpreter indicated?;#!<br /><br /><br />The &quot #!&quot  is actually a two-byte magic number, a special marker that designates a file type, or in this case an executable shell script. After this is the path to the program that interprets the commands in the script, whether it be a shell, a programming language, or a utility.

722;;140;What is the syntax for the until loop command?;until condition<br>do<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp script commands<br>done
723;;140;What is the syntax for the for loop command?;for arg in [list]<br />do <br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp script commands<br />done<br><br /><br>If 'do' is on same line as 'for', there needs to be a semicolon after list.<br><br /><br>for arg in [list]   do 
724;;140;In script loops with seq running number sequences what are the general rules?;1. If a single value is listed then the sequence starts at one, increments by one, until the specified value. <br /><br />2. If you specify two values it starts at the first value, increments by one, and ends at the second value. <br /><br />3. If three values are listed the sequence starts the first number, increments by the second number, and ends at the third value. 
725;;141;What command is used to print to standard out columns or fields that you specify from a file?;cut<br /><br /><br />Print selected parts of lines from each file to standard output. Some options are:<br /><br /><br />-b, --bytes=LIST<br /><br /><br />select only these bytes<br /><br /><br />-c, --characters=LIST<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />select only these characters<br /><br /><br />-d, --delimiter=DELIM<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />use the specified character instead of TAB for field delimiter<br /><br /><br />-f, --fields=LIST<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />select&nbsp &nbsp only&nbsp &nbsp these&nbsp &nbsp fields &nbsp &nbsp also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless the -s option is specified<br /><br /><br />-s, --only-delimited<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />do not print lines not containing delimiters<br /><br />
726;;141;Using the cut command list the name of each group in /etc/group.;cut -d: -f1 /etc/group<br><br /><br>-d:<br><br /><br>This changes from the default tab delimiter to using a colons which is how the fields are seperated in /etc/group.<br><br /><br>-f1<br><br /><br>This means list only the first field. 
727;;141;What commands remove and adds tabs in file output?;expand -t number filename<br /><br />Remove the tabs and replace them with '-t number' of spaces. The default is eight. <br /><br />unexpand -t number filename<br /><br />Convert the spaces to tabs. By default eight contiguous spaces are converted into tabs. Use the '-t' option to specifiy a different number of spaces. <br /><br />By default unexpand will only convert leading spaces at the beginning of each line. To convert all spaces use the '-a' option.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
728;;141;What does the fmt command do?;Reformat each paragraph in the file or files and write them to standard output. <br /><br />-w, --width=WIDTH<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />maximum line width (default of 75 columns)<br /><br />Example syntax: fmt -w 80 filename
729;;141;What command will take two files and put them together using fields from the files?;join<br /><br /><br />For each pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a line to standard output. The default join field is the first, delimited by whitespace. <br /><br /><br />Example syntax: join -j first_filename second_filename<br /><br /><br />-j FIELD<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />equivalent to `-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'<br /><br /><br />-1 FIELD<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />join on this FIELD of file 1<br /><br /><br />-2 FIELD<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />join on this FIELD of file 2<br /><br />
730;;141;What command is similar to the command 'join' but offers less options?;paste<br /><br /><br />`paste' writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially<br />corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.<br />Standard input is used for a file name of `-' or if no input files are<br />given.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For example:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp $ cat num2<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp $ cat let3<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp b<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp $ paste num2 let3<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp b<br /><br />
731;;142;What command can be used to add line numbers to a text file at the beginning of every line?;nl<br><br /><br>The `nl' command writes each file, or standard input if none are given, to standard output, with line numbers added to some or all of the lines depending on options.&nbsp &nbsp 
732;;142;What command by default outputs in the octal format, but can output depending on options in decimal, hexidecimal, floating point and ASCII?;od<br /><br /><br />The 'od' command in Linux is used to output the contents of a file in different formats with the octal format being the default. This command is especially useful when debugging Linux scripts for unwanted changes or characters.<br /><br /><br />host # od -c file<br />0000000 a b c \r d e f \n<br />0000010<br /><br /><br />Notice with the &quot -c&quot  flag used we can see the output of '\r' which is the control character.

Common options are:<br /><br />-d <br /><br />Double-space the output.<br /><br />-l page_length <br /><br />Set the number of lines in a page length with the default being 66. <br /><br />-o margin<br /><br />This sets the margin (number of spaces at the beginning of a line) with the default being zero.<br /><br />
735;;142;What is the bash builtin stream text editor?;sed<br /><br />A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits, `sed' works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.&nbsp &nbsp But it is `sed''s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors. It outputs to standardout so if you need to save then redirect the output. 
736;;142;What is the synatx for the sed command to replace all occurances of 'this' with 'that' in a file from some_file to new_file?;sed s/this/that &lt some_file &gt  new_file<br /><br /><br />If you have meta-characters in the sed command, quotes are necessary. <br /><br /><br />Example 's/this/that/g' &lt some_file &gt  new_file<br><br /><br>The 'g' option makes the replacement global. If this is not used then only the first occurance on every line is replaced.
737;;142;Using the sed command remove null from myfile.txt and write it to newfile.txt.;sed '/null/d' &lt myfile.txt &gt  newfile.txt
738;;143;In the command sed what is the usually delimiter?;/<br /><br />Forward slash <br /><br />It is possible to use other characters as a delimiter.<br /><br />~$ echo day | sed s:day:night:<br />night<br />~$ echo day | sed s_day_night_<br />night<br /><br />
739;;143;How can you take file old_file.txt, delete lines 3 through 5 with the sed command, and output to new_file.txt? ;sed '3,5d' &lt old_file.txt &gt  new_file.txt
740;;143;Using the sed command take old_file.txt and delete all lines except 3 through 5 and output to new_file.txt.;sed '3,5!d' old_file.txt &gt  new_file.txt 
741;;143;What option with the sed command allow replacement in the original file instead of porting to standard out?;sed -i 
742;;143;With the sed command if you want to replace all instance of 'That' or 'This' with 'Where' in the old_file.txt to create new_file.txt what is the syntax?;sed 's/That|This/Where/g' old_file.txt &gt  new_file.txt
743;;143;Use the command sed to delete the last line in old_file.txt and output to standard out.;sed '$d' old_file.txt
744;;144;The dos2unix utility is a way of removing DOS line breaks (^M) from files. What syntax with the sed command will remove these also?;sed 's/.$//' &lt old_file.txt &gt  new_file.txt
745;;144;The command awk is an acronym for what?;Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan
746;;144;What command is described as a &quot pattern scanning and processing language&quot ?;Awk<br><br /><br>The command awk treats each line of text as a record and each seperate word as a sperated field in that record. It can be considered a programming language. It reads one line at a time, performs some action depending on the condition you give it and outputs the result to standard out. 
747;;144;What is the syntax for the awk command?;awk ' condition { action }' 
748;;144;What are some string constants used in awk command?;String constants in AWK are sequences of characters enclosed between double quotes (&quot ). Within strings, certain escape sequences are recognized, as in C. These are:<br><br /><br>\\<br>A literal backslash.<br><br /><br>\a<br>The ``alert'' character  usually the ASCII BEL character.<br><br /><br>\b<br>backspace<br><br /><br>\f<br>form-feed<br><br /><br>\n<br>newline<br><br /><br>\r<br>carriage return<br><br /><br>\t<br>horizontal tab<br><br /><br>\v<br>vertical tab.
749;;144;The commands awk and egrep use regular expressions. What are some of the basic regular expressions used?;c<br />matches the non-metacharacter c<br /><br /><br />\c<br />matches the literal character c<br /><br /><br />.<br />matches any character including newline<br /><br /><br />^<br />matches the beginning of a string<br /><br /><br />$<br />matches the end of a string<br /><br /><br />[abc...]<br />character list, matches any of the characters abc....<br /><br /><br />[^abc...]<br />negated character list, matches any character except abc....<br /><br /><br />r1|r2<br />alternation: matches either r1 or r2<br /><br /><br />r1r2<br />concatenation: matches r1, and then r2<br /><br /><br />r+<br />matches one or more r's<br /><br /><br />r*<br />matches zero or more r's<br /><br /><br />r?<br />matches zero or one r's<br /><br /><br />\y<br />matches the empty string at either the beginning or the end of a word<br /><br /><br />\B<br />matches the empty string within a word<br /><br /><br />\&lt <br />matches the empty string at the beginning of a word<br /><br /><br />\&gt <br />matches the empty string at the end of a word<br /><br /><br />\w<br />matches any word-constituent character (letter, digit, or underscore)<br /><br /><br />\W<br />matches any character that is not word-constituent<br /><br /><br />\`<br />matches the empty string at the beginning of a buffer (string)<br /><br /><br />\'<br />matches the empty string at the end of a buffer
750;;144;What is the syntax to use an awk script inside the awk command?;awk -f script.awk inputfile<br><br /><br>-f program-file<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Read the AWK program source from the file program-file, instead of from the first command line&nbsp &nbsp argument. 
751;;130;What are some of the strings used to manipulate text space in the awk command?;\t Inserts a tab character.<br><br /><br>\n Adds a newline character.<br><br /><br>\f Adds a form feed character.<br><br /><br>\r Adds a carriage return.
752;;130;What are the three modes of operation for the sort command?;The command sort has three modes of operation: sort (the default), merge, and<br>check for sortedness.
753;;130;What option with the sort command ignores case?;sort -f<br><br /><br>Fold lowercase characters into the equivalent uppercase characters when comparing so that, for example, `b' and `B' sort as equal.<br><br />
754;;130;What option with the sort command sorts by month?;-M<br /><br /><br />An initial string, consisting of any amount of blanks, followed by a month name abbreviation, is folded to UPPER case and compared in the order `JAN' &lt  `FEB' &lt  ... &lt  `DEC'. 
755;;130;Use the sort command on some_file.txt to give it numerical order to standard out.;sort -n some_file.txt<br /><br /><br />`-n'<br /><br /><br />Sort numerically.&nbsp &nbsp The number begins each line and consists of optional blanks, an optional `-' sign, and zero or more digits possibly separated by thousands separators, optionally followed by a decimal-point character and zero or more digits.&nbsp &nbsp An empty number is treated as `0'.
756;;130;What option with the sort command outputs to reverse order?;-r<br /><br /><br />Reverse the result of comparison, so that lines with greater key values appear earlier in the output instead of late.
757;;130;What command by default will output the file in 1000 line segments to standard out?;split<br /><br />split [OPTION] [INPUT [PREFIX]]<br /><br />By default, `split' puts 1000 lines of INPUT (or whatever is left over for the last section), into each output file. The output files' names consist of PREFIX (`x' by default) followed<br />by a group of characters (`aa', `ab', ... by default), such that concatenating the output files in traditional sorted order by file name produces the original input file<br /><br />You can specify different amounts of lines with the -n option or more directly with a number.<br /><br />Example: split -1 file.txt<br /><br />This will output one line at a time. 
758;;131;What command is used to translate or delete characters, but needs standard input so is often used with a pipe?;tr<br /><br />Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters.<br /><br />tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]<br /><br />The tr command copies standard input to standard output, performing one of the following operations:<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * translate, and optionally squeeze repeated characters in the<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp result,<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * squeeze repeated characters,<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * delete characters,<br /><br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * delete characters, then squeeze repeated characters from the<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp result.<br /><br /><br />
759;;131;Use the tr command to translate all upper case characters in the my_file.txt to lowercase written to my_newfile.txt.;cat my_file.txt | tr A-Z a-z &gt  my_newfile.txt<br /><br />An alternate to this syntax is:<br /><br />tr &quot [:upper:]&quot  &quot [:lower:]&quot 
760;;131;What are some common options with the tr command?;Keeping in mind the syntax of tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]<br /><br />-c <br /><br />Complement the set of characters in SET1<br /><br />-d<br /><br />Delete characters in SET1, do not translate<br /><br />-s<br /><br />Replace each input sequence of a repeated character that is listed in SET1 with a single occurrence of that character. <br /><br />-t<br /><br />first truncate SET1 to length of SET2
761;;131;The tr command has a list of standard arguements. What is their syntax and some of the examples of them?;Each tr standard arguement consists of a word or abbreviation surrounded by colons and then enclosed in a set of square brackets. Some examples are:<br /><br />[:alpha:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all letters<br /><br />[:blank:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all horizontal whitespace<br /><br />[:cntrl:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all control characters<br /><br />[:digit:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all digits<br /><br />[:graph:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all printable characters, not including space<br /><br />[:lower:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all lower case letters<br /><br />[:print:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all printable characters, including space<br /><br />[:punct:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all punctuation characters<br /><br />[:space:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all horizontal or vertical whitespace<br /><br />[:upper:]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />all upper case letters<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
762;;131;What command can report or omit repeated lines?;uniq<br /><br />Syntax: uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]<br /><br />Some common options are:<br /><br />-d<br /><br />Only print duplicate lines. When used by itself, this option causes uniq to print the first copy of each repeated line, and nothing else.<br /><br />-i<br /><br />Ignore differences in case when comparing lines.<br /><br />-u<br /><br />Discard the first repeated line.&nbsp &nbsp When used by itself, this option causes `uniq' to print unique lines, and nothing else.<br />
763;;131;Use the uniq command on my_file.txt and compensate for lines not adjacent.;sort my_file.txt | uniq <br><br /><br>The input need not be sorted, but repeated input lines are detected only if they are adjacent. By piping through the sort command you can get around this issue. 
764;;131;What command prints the number of newline, word, and byte counts for each file?;wc<br /><br />Some options for the word count command are:<br /><br />-c <br /><br />print the byte counts<br /><br />-m<br /><br />print the character counts<br /><br />-l<br /><br />print the newline counts<br /><br />-L <br /><br />print the length of the longest line<br /><br />-w <br /><br />print the word counts 
765;;131;What is command substitution?;Command substitution means to run a shell command and store its output to a variable or display back using echo command. Command substitution is basically another way to do a pipe.<br /><br />You can use the grave accent (`) to perform a command substitution.<br /><br />Example syntax: command `other_command`<br /><br />Or you can use parantheses and make a variable: command $(other_command)
766;;132;By default what is the maximum length of a bash command line?;128KB<br /><br />You can use the xargs command to break down long commands to 128KB chunks. <br /><br />For example if you want to delete all backup files which usually end with tidle (~):<br /><br />find ~/ -name &quot ~*&quot  | xargs rm
767;;132;What is the syntax for writing a shell function?;function_name ()<br />{<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp command1<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp command2<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp command3<br />}<br><br /><br>Shell functions can save time in scripts. Once the function is defined it can be used multiple times in the script.

769;;90;What are the 7 layers of the OSI model?;1. Physical<br>2. Data Link<br>3. Network<br>4. Transport<br>5. Session<br>6. Presentation<br>7. Application
770;;90;What are the major classes of of IPv4 addresses?;-- Class A, leading bit of 0 (left hand side),<br /><br /><br />Size of the network number bit field 8 (left hand side), size of the host number bit field 24, number of networks 126, start address 0.0.0.0, end address 127.255.255.255<br /><br /><br />-- Class B, leading bits of 10<br /><br /><br />Size of the network number bit field 16, size of the host number bit field 16, number of networks 16,384, start address 128.0.0.0, end address 191.255.255.255<br /><br /><br />-- Class C, leading bits of 110<br /><br /><br />Size of the network number bit field 24, size of the host number bit field 8, number of networks 2,097,152, start address 192.0.0.0, end address 223.255.255.255<br /><br /><br />-- Class D, leading bits of 1110<br /><br /><br />Multicast addresses, start address 224.0.0.0, end address 239.255.255.255<br /><br /><br />-- Class D, leading bits of 1111<br /><br /><br />Reserved, start address 240.0.0.0, end address 255.255.255.255 
771;;90;What are the address ranges considered private and publically not routable?;10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (Class A)<br><br /><br>172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (Class B)<br><br /><br>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (Class C)
772;;90;What is the purpose of the subnet mask?;It defines the network portion (left side) and the host portion (right side). Take each octet and convert from decimal to binary.<br /><br />Decimal:255.255.240.0<br /><br />Binary: 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000<br /><br />This leaves 12 bits for hosts. To find the number host take 2 to the power of 12 (2^12). This gives you 4096. Then subtract 2 because you reserve the first IP address for the network address and the last IP address for the broadcast address. This gives you 4094 hosts.<br /><br /><br /><br />
773;;90;Using the 172.16.x.x/12 private subnet create a subnet mask that allows for 300 hosts and determine the amount of subnets from this.;-- Find the amount of binary bits that have 300 or slightly over.<br><br /><br>1 1111 1111 (2^9 = 512 and 2^8 = 256 so to meet the requirement you must choose 9 bits because 8 bits is to small)<br><br /><br>-- These bits are host bits. These are the amount of zeros on the left hand side you will need to keep. (0.00000000). Turn the rest to ones. So this:<br><br /><br>11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000 <br><br /><br>Goes to this:<br><br /><br>11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000<br><br /><br>-- Use the bits beyond the subnet mask to determine the subnet bits.<br><br /><br>Subnet Mask:&nbsp &nbsp 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000<br>Bits Mask:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000<br><br /><br>This leaves an 11 bit difference. That difference is the amount of subnets available. Take 2^11 giving you 2048 subnets. <br><br /><br>The host are 2^9 giving 512 minus one for the network address and one for the broadcast address. The usable host then come out to be 510.
774;;91;In Linux what is a &quot flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers.&quot ;dig<br /><br />DNS lookup utility(domain information groper)<br /><br />It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when the -h option is given.
775;;91;What is the typical numbering scheme for multiple NICs on a Linux device?;eth0, eth1, eth2, .... ethn<br><br /><br>The numbering starts a zero, goes up and gets added to the prefix of &quot eth&quot .
776;;91;What four parameters are usually configured in order for your Linux device to participate in the network?;1. IP address<br><br /><br>2. Subnet Mask<br><br /><br>3. Default gateway address<br><br /><br>4. DNS server address
777;;91;What command can be used to configure a network interface?;ifconfig<br /><br />Ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary. After that, it is usually only needed when debugging or when system tuning is needed.<br /><br />If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the status of the currently active interfaces. If a single interface argument is given, it displays the status of the given interface only  if a single&nbsp &nbsp -a&nbsp &nbsp argument is given, it displays the status of all interfaces, even those that are down.&nbsp &nbsp Otherwise, it configures an interface.<br /><br />Usually to make things persistent on reboot the appropriate configuration file for the distribution must be modified.
778;;91;What is some information you would get in the output of the ifconfig command?;HWaddr - The MAC address.<br><br /><br>inet addr - IP address of the interface.<br><br /><br>Bcast - The broadcast address fo the network segment.<br><br /><br>Mask - Subnet mask.<br><br /><br>RX packets - Statistics on received packets.<br><br /><br>TX packets - Statistics on transmitted packets.<br><br /><br>Collisions - Ethernet collisions detected.<br><br /><br>RX bytes - Bytes received since boot time.<br><br /><br>TX bytes - Bytes transmitted since boot time.<br><br />
779;;91;Using the ifconfig command assign to the first interface an IP of 192.168.5.10 with a Class C subnet mask and a broadcast address live. ;ifconfig eth0 down<br>ifconfig eth0 192.168.5.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.5.255<br>inconfig eth0 up<br><br /><br>This change usually will need a root login or run with sudo. 
780;;92;What are the network configuration files on a Red Hat/Cent OS system?;/etc/hosts<br /><br />The main purpose of this file is to resolve hostnames that cannot be resolved any other way.

806;;106;What does CUPS stand for?;Common UNIX Printing System
807;;106;CUPS supports network printing through what protocol?;The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) provides a standard network protocol for remote printing as well as for managing print jobs, media size, resolution, and other options.<br><br /><br>IPP is reference in these RFCs:<br><br /><br>2911 - Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics<br><br /><br>3380 - Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Job and Printer Set Operations<br><br /><br>3382 - Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): The 'collection' attribute syntax<br><br /><br>3995 - Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions<br><br /><br>3996 - Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): The 'ippget' Delivery Method for Event Notifications
808;;106;CUPS supports network printing through the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). What port does this operate on?;631
809;;106;What are some of the components of the CUPS system?;1. CUPS Scheduler <br /><br />The CUPS scheduler implements Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTP/1.1(web server). A helper application (cups-lpd) converts Line Printer Daemon protocol (LPD) requests to IPP.<br /><br />2. Filters<br /><br />Printers use a variety of page description languages (PDL.) CUPS uses filters to covert to a PostScript or CUPS-raster format. The filtering process works by taking input data pre-formatted with six arguments: the job ID of the print job, the user-name, the job-name,the number of copies to print, any print options and the filename.<br /><br />3. Backends<br /><br />The backends provide an interface between the scheduler and the actual printer hardware. Backends are provided for different printer interfaces like parallel, serial, USB, and other network backends. <br /><br />4. PostScript Printer Description Files (PPD)<br /><br />A PPD files contains commands that invoke the features for the print job. <br /><br />5. Web-based Administration Utility<br /><br />http://&lt server_IP&gt :631
810;;108;Where are the CUPS filters stored?;/usr/lib/cups/filter

858;;177;What is listed in /proc/driver/rtc?;The current time of the hardware clock.<br><br /><br>cat /proc/driver/rtc<br>rtc_time	: 21:28:13<br>rtc_date	: 2012-10-14<br>alrm_time	: 16:17:13<br>alrm_date	: 2012-10-15<br>alarm_IRQ	: no<br>alrm_pending	: no<br>update IRQ enabled	: no<br>periodic IRQ enabled	: no<br>periodic IRQ frequency	: 1024<br>max user IRQ frequency	: 64<br>24hr		: yes<br>periodic_IRQ	: no<br>update_IRQ	: no<br>HPET_emulated	: yes<br>BCD		: yes<br>DST_enable	: no<br>periodic_freq	: 1024<br><br />"
859;;177;What is the syntax and command options for the hwclock command to set to a specific time?;hwclock --set --date=date_string
860;;177;What option for the hwclock command will set the system time from the current time in the hardware clock?;hwclock -s<br><br /><br>hwclock --hctosys<br><br /><br>Set the System Time from the Hardware Clock.<br><br /><br>Also set the kernel's timezone value to the local timezone as indicated by the TZ environment variable and/or /usr/share/zoneinfo, as tzset would interpret them.
861;;178;What will the command 'hwclock -w' do?;Both -w and --systohc<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time.<br><br />
862;;178;What option with the hwclock command indicates that the Hardware Clock is kept in Coordinated Universal Time or local time?<br><br /><br><br />;--utc<br>--localtime 
863;;178;What command takes a list of names of Internet hosts as arguments, selects the one which supplies the best time, and sets the system time accordingly?;netdate<br /><br />The netdate command can query serveral servers and take a comparison to find the most accurate time server. The time server is usually configured to listen on UDP port 37. <br /><br />The netdate command is better for a single query as it is not practical to run with in a cron job. If you are looking for time polling over time use the NTP protocol through the ntpdate command. 
864;;178;What port does the network time protocol operate over?;Port 123
865;;178;When your system is configured for NTP your system's time can be maintained to within milliseconds of what?;Coordinated Universal Time
866;;179;NTP uses a hierarchy of semi-layered system of levels of clock sources called stratum. What are the levels of stratum?;Stratum 0<br /><br /><br />These are devices such as atomic (cesium, rubidium) clocks, GPS clocks or other radio clocks. Stratum-0 devices are traditionally not attached to the network  instead they are locally connected to computer.<br /><br /><br />Stratum 1<br /><br /><br />These are clients of the stratum 0 devices. <br /><br /><br />Stratum 2<br /><br /><br />These are clients of the stratum 1 servers. <br><br /><br>While NTP (depending on what version of NTP protocol in use) supports up to 256 strata, only the first 16 are employed and any device at Stratum 16 is considered to be unsynchronized.
867;;179;What is the difference between slewing and stepping in the NTP time protocol. ;The NTP protocol start syncing time between the client and server about once per minute. Over time the interval increases to once every 17 minutes. <br><br /><br>If the difference is less than 128 milliseconds time is adjusted gradually in a process called slewing. <br><br /><br>If the difference is more than 128 milliseconds time is adjusted more quickly in a process called stepping. 
868;;179;At what point of difference between the NTP client and server will the NTP daemon not adjust time?;If the difference is more than 17 minutes ntpd considers the time to be &quot insane&quot  and will not adjust time. 
869;;179;NTP measures and corrects for clock frequency errors called drift. It writes a current frequency value to what file where?;It writes to a ntp.drift. It could be in these locations:<br /><br />/var/lib/ntp/drift<br /><br />/etc/ntp/drift
870;;180;What are some simple entries you may find in the ntp.conf file? ;# --- GENERAL CONFIGURATION ---<br />server&nbsp &nbsp &lt some_outside_ntp_server_IP&gt <br /><br /># An alias for the internal server to be used if it can not reach the remote server. <br /><br />server&nbsp &nbsp 127.127.1.0<br />fudge&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 127.127.1.0 stratum 10<br /><br /># Prohibit general access to this service.<br />restrict default ignore<br /><br /># Permit systems on this network to synchronize with this<br /># time service. But not modify our time.<br />restrict &lt IP_address&gt  nomodify<br /><br /># Allow the following unrestricted access to ntpd<br /><br />restrict &lt IP_address&gt <br />restrict 127.0.0.1
871;;180;What command utility program is used to monitor NTP daemon ntpd operations and determine performance?;ntpq<br /><br />-n<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than converting to the canonical host names. <br /><br />-p<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of their state.
872;;180;What command will trace a chain of NTP servers back to the primary source?<br /><br />;ntptrace<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />-d&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br /><br />Turn on some debugging output.<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />-n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br /><br />Turn off the printing of host names  instead, host IP addresses are given.&nbsp &nbsp This may be necessary if a nameserver is down.<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />-r retries<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Set the number of retransmission attempts for each host  the default is 5.<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />-t timeout<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Set the retransmission timeout (in seconds)  the default is 2.<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />-v&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br /><br />Print verbose information about the NTP servers.
873;;15;What are some of the basic logical components of an email system?;MUA - Mail User Agent<br /><br /><br />This is typically thought of as the client software side. It is configured to send messages to a mail server. <br /><br /><br />MTA - Mail Tranfer Agent<br /><br /><br />A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) transfers email messages between hosts using SMTP. An MTA implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.<br /><br /><br />MDA - Mail Delivery Agent/Message Delivery Agent<br /><br /><br />Any program that actually handles a message for delivery to the point where it can be read by an email client application can be considered an MDA. The MDA will store the message until the MUA of the recipients requests it. <br /><br /><br /><br />
874;;15;What are some common MTAs for linux?;Common Mail Transfer agents for Linux are:<br /><br /><br />1. sendmail - The oldest MTA which runs as a single executable.<br><br />2. postfix - Postfix has replaced sendmail in most distributions. It uses a master daemon in conjuction with worker daemons that are only started on demand. <br /><br /><br />3. qmail - This is a modular daemon like postfix, but was designed from the beginning with security in mind. It uses some proprietary license agreements. <br /><br /><br />4. exim - Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge for use on Unix like systems. It is a single executable like sendmail.&nbsp &nbsp 
875;;15;What two additional protocols are implemented by qmail?;1. Quick Mail Queuing Protocol (QMQP)<br><br /><br>QMQP allos the sharing of email queues among different MTAs.<br><br /><br>2. Quick Mail Transport Protocol (QMTP)<br><br /><br>This protocol is like SMTP, but operates faster. 
876;;15;By default you user's mail queue is stored in what directory?;/var/spool/mail
877;;16;List the command and options to have the program mail list of a summary of interactive mail commands.;mail -?
878;;16;When you enter 'mail' at the command line it checks /var/spool/mail/&lt username&gt  for messages and enters interactive mode if mail exists. How can you read the message in this mode?;t &lt message_number&gt <br><br /><br>If there were three messages in /var/spool/mail then 't 2' would open the second message. 
879;;16;When you run mail in interactive mode what option deletes the mail?;d &lt message_number&gt <br /><br />To undelete the message at the mail ? prompt type:<br /><br />u &lt message_number&gt <br /><br /><br /><br />
880;;16;When you run the mail command without options and there is mail in /var/spool/mail/&lt username&gt  what is the interactive command prompt?;?
881;;17;At the mail prompt (?) what option do you use to display the next message?;n<br><br /><br>This will move to the next message in the queue. 
882;;17;At the mail command prompt (?) what is the option to reply to the sender?;R &lt message_number&gt <br><br /><br>You can reply to all recipients by entering 'r &lt message_number&gt '. 
883;;17;When in the mail command prompt (?) what is the option to send a new message?;m &lt recipient&gt <br><br /><br>After your done with mail creation use the 'q' option to quit out of the mail program.
884;;17;When using the interactive mail commmand sending mail what must you do before the mail gets sent?;Enter CTRL-D<br /><br /><br />This exits the creation and sends the message. 
885;;18;When quitting the interactive mail prompt what is the difference between exitting with 'q' and 'x'?;q<br><br /><br>This exits the program and takes your mail and appends it to mbox under /home/&lt user_name&gt /mbox.<br><br /><br>x<br><br /><br>This exits the program, but leaves the mail in /var/spool/mail/&lt user_name&gt .
886;;18;What command will print the mail queue?;mailq<br><br /><br>-v&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Prints verbose information. 
887;;18;What file provides a method of redirect mail to another user for both local and remote users?;/etc/aliases<br><br /><br>The Syntax is:<br><br /><br>name: value1, value2, ...<br><br /><br>Example:<br><br /><br>postmaster:&nbsp &nbsp root<br>mailer-daemon:&nbsp &nbsp postmaster<br>sales: tom@example.com
888;;18;After editing the /etc/aliases file what must you do?;Reload the aliases with the newaliases command. 
889;;18;What can an individual use that acts like the /etc/aliases file?;~/.forward<br /><br /><br />If the file is present the contents are read and treated as an alias for that person's email. If a .forward file with the line remote@example.com exist all the email would be forwarded to that address instead of delivered to the local mailbox.
890;;173;What are the two most common database services implemented on Linux?;1. MySQL<br><br /><br>2. PostgreSQL
891;;173;What does acronym SQL stand for?;Structured Query Language
892;;173;How are relational databases organized?;Relational databases are organized with fields, records, and tables. <br><br /><br>field - A single entry of information.<br><br /><br>record - One complete set of fields.<br><br /><br>tables - A collection of records. 
893;;173;SQL has a Data Manipulation Language (DML) and a Data Definition Language (DDL). What is DML used for and what are some basic commands?;The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is used to run query and update commands. Some basic commands are:<br /><br /><br />SELECT - Extracts information from a table.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE - Modifies or updates information in a table.<br /><br /><br />DELETE - Deletes data from a table. <br /><br /><br />INSERT INTO - Adds data to a table.
894;;174;SQL has a Data Manipulation Language (DML) and a Data Definition Language (DDL). What is DDL used for and what are some basic commands?;The Data Definition Language (DDL) permits database tables to be created or deleted. I also defines indexes (keys), specifies links between tables, and imposes restrictions between tables. Some basic commands are:<br><br /><br>CREATE DATABASE - Creates a new database. <br><br /><br>ALTER DATABASE - Modifies a database.<br><br /><br>CREATE TABLE - Creates a new table.<br><br /><br>ALTER TABLE - Modifies an existing table.<br><br /><br>DROP TABLE - Deletes an existing table. <br><br /><br>CREATE INDEX - Creates an index (search key).<br><br /><br>DROP INDEX - Deletes and index.
895;;174;MySQL has its own access controls and user accounts. It does not use the accounts in the Linux system. What five tables are implemented in within MySQL for this?;user - Specifies if a user is allowed to connect to the MySQL server.<br><br /><br>db - Defines what databases a user is allowed to access. <br><br /><br>host - Specifies what hosts are allowed to access a particular database. <br><br /><br>tables_priv - Defines access privileges for a given table. <br><br /><br>columns_priv - Specifies access privileges for columns of data for a given table. 
896;;174;What command initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the system tables that it contains, if they do not exist?;mysql_install_db<br /><br /><br />Because the MySQL server, mysqld, needs to access the data directory when it runs later, you should either run mysql_install_db from the same account that will be used for running mysqld or run it as root and use the --user option to indicate the user name that mysqld will run as.<br /><br /><br />Example: mysql_install_db --user=mysql<br><br /><br>--user=user_name<br><br /><br>The login user name to use for running mysqld. Files and directories created by mysqld will be owned by this user. You must be root to use this option. By default, mysqld runs using your current login name and files and directories that it creates will be owned by you. 
897;;174;What two accounts are created on MySQL&nbsp &nbsp after initializing the database table?;1. root<br><br /><br>2. anonymous-user
898;;174;To verify MySQL accounts at the mysql prompt what command can be executed?;SELECT User, Host, Password FROM mysql.user 
899;;175;What is the command line client for administering a MySQL server?;mysqladmin<br /><br />Some useful options are:<br /><br />ping<br /><br />Check whether the server is available. The return status from mysqladmin is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is 0 even in case of an error such as Access denied, because this means that the server is running but refused the connection, which is different from the server not running.<br /><br />status<br /><br />Display a short server status message.<br /><br />version<br /><br />Display version information from the server.
900;;175;What is the client commmand for MySQL that can be used to quickly see which databases exist, their tables, or a table's columns or indexes? ;mysqlshow<br><br /><br>For information on a specific table enter:<br><br /><br>mysqlshow &lt table_name&gt 
901;;175;Once you have MySQL installed you will need to set the root password. What is the syntax for that?;mysqladmin -u root password &lt new_password&gt <br><br /><br>If you are changing an already established password then the syntax is:<br><br /><br>mysqladmin -u root -p'&lt old_password&gt ' password &lt new_password&gt 
902;;175;What tool in Ubuntu 12.04 is replacing mysqladmin?;mysql-workbench<br><br /><br><br />
903;;175;What is the syntax for running the MySQL client at the shell prompt?;mysql -h &lt hostname&gt  -u &lt user_name&gt  -p<br><br /><br>Entering this you will then be prompted for the users password. After you will be at the mysql prompt:<br><br /><br>mysql&gt 
904;;176;What command at the 'mysql&gt ' prompt will allow you to switch to another database?;USE &lt database_name&gt <br><br /><br><br />
905;;176;At the 'mysql&gt ' prompt create a table called 'friends' with first_name, last_name, and phone number. Verfiy the table exists.&nbsp &nbsp Add an entry for Mary Fishburne 752-555-1000 and then dispaly the full table. ;CREATE TABLE friends (first_name VARCHAR(15), last_name VARCHAR(15), phone CHAR(12)) <br />DESCRIBE friends<br />INSERT INTO friends VALUES ('Mary','Fishburne','752-555-1000') <br />SELECT * FROM friends
906;;176;The MySQL 'friends' database table has entries for first_name, last_name, and phone. At the 'mysql&gt ' prompt use the SELECT command to search for the record containing the phone string of 752-555-1000. ;SELECT * FROM friends WHERE phone='752-555-1000' 
907;;176;The MySQL 'friends' database table has entries for first_name, last_name, and phone. Use the DELETE command at the 'mysql&gt ' prompt to remove the record for the last_name Fishburne.;DELETE FROM friends WHERE last_name='Fishburne' <br><br /><br>As a note generally before deletion you want to confirm the record first:<br><br /><br>SELECT FROM friends WHERE last_name='Fishburne' 
908;;176;At the 'mysql&gt ' prompt use the UDPATE command and the first_name field to change Mary Fishburne's last name to Smith in the friends table last_name field. ;UPDATE friends SET last_name=Smith WHERE first_name='Mary'  
909;;145;How can you log out leaving system more secure while a proces is running?;nohup &lt command&gt  &amp 
910;;145;What is the general rule about how adminitrators should log in?;All users should including the administrator should log in with a standard user account. If you need root access use the su or sudo commands.
911;;145;The su command allows running with a subtitute user which often is root. What are some of the most useful options for this command?;-c&nbsp &nbsp &lt command&gt  <br /><br />Passes a single command to the shell. <br /><br />-m <br /><br />Switches to the user account but preserves the existing enviromental variables. <br /><br />- or -l<br /><br />Loads the user's environmental variables. This is important when changing to root as you load root's environmental variables. 
912;;145;What is the main function of the sudo command?;The command sudo allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user. Its name is a concatenation of the su command and &quot do&quot  which is to take action. 
913;;145;What file does the sudo command use to determine what user is authorized to run which commands?;/etc/sudoers
914;;150;What is the expected way to edit the /etc/sudoers file?;This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.<br><br />
915;;150;What is the variable in the /etc/sudoers file controls the timeout on permissions?;Defaults:ALL timestamp_timeout=15<br><br /><br>Usually the default is 15 minutes. 
916;;150;What option can you give the sudo command to find out what permissions are granted?;sudo -l<br /><br />$ sudo -l<br />Matching Defaults entries for user on this host:<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp env_reset, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin<br /><br />User user may run the following commands on this host:<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (ALL : ALL) ALL<br /><br />
917;;150;What is the syntax to use sudo to run as a user other than root?;sudo -u username command 
918;;150;The /etc/sudoers file uses aliases to determine who is authorized to run which commands. What are some of those aliases and what they define?;Each alias definition is of the form:<br><br /><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ..<br><br /><br>User_Alias<br><br /><br>User aliases are used to specify groups of users. You can specify usernames, system groups (prefixed by a %) and netgroups (prefixed by a +).<br><br /><br>Cmd_Alias<br><br /><br>Command aliases are lists of commands and directories. <br><br /><br>Host_Alias<br><br /><br>A host alias is a list of hostname, ip addresses, networks and netgroups (prefixed with a +). If you do not specify a netmask with a network the netmask of the hosts ethernet interface(s) will be used when matching. <br><br /><br>Runas_Alias<br><br /><br>Runas Aliases are almost the same as user aliases but you are allowed to specify users by uid's. This is helpful as usernames and groups are matched as strings so two users with the same uid but different usernames will not be matched by entering a single username but can be matched with a uid.
919;;150;What command is used to change user password expiry information?;chage<br><br /><br>Syntax: chage [options] [LOGIN]<br><br /><br>Some useful options are:<br><br /><br>-m MIN_DAYS<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Set the minimum number of days between password changes to MIN_DAYS. A value of zero for this field indicates that the user may change his/her password at any time.<br><br /><br>-M MAX_DAYS<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Set the maximum number of days during which a password is valid. This occurrence can be planned for in advance by use of the -W option, which provides the user with advance warning.<br><br /><br>-W WARN_DAYS<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required.<br><br /><br><br /><br><br />
920;;151;Where should user passwords not be stored?;/etc/passwd<br /><br /><br />Many processes on the Linux system access this file exposing a security risk. Passwords should be in /etc/shadow. You can use the pwconv command to move passwords from /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow. 
921;;151;What security exploit can you not configure against on your Linux system?;Social Engineering<br><br /><br>Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
922;;151;In the context of Linux what does PAM mean?;Puggable Authentication Modules<br><br /><br>Pluggable Authentication Modules is a suite of shared libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.

949;;156;What command is commonly used to setup packet filter rules in the Linux kernel? ;Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.<br><br /><br>Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.<br><br />
950;;157;What are the one of three chains in iptables a packet must go through?;INPUT <br><br /><br>A packet going to the system incoming in an interface. <br><br /><br>OUTPUT<br><br /><br>A packet generated by the system leaving an interface.<br><br /><br>FORWARD<br><br /><br>A packet going through the system. 
951;;157;What are the iptable chains which can not be modified or redefinned?;ACCEPT - The packet is accepted.<br><br /><br>DROP - The packet is ignored.<br><br /><br>RETURN - End of the current program or application of the default policy for Input, Output and Forward.<br><br /><br>REJECT - The packet is rejected.<br><br /><br>LOG - The packet is logged. <br><br /><br>QUEUE - The packet is forwarded to a user program which will decide of it's fate.

If no chain is selected, all chains are listed. Like every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the default), so NAT rules get listed by iptables -t nat -n -L. Please note that it is often used with the -n option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups.&nbsp &nbsp 
953;;157;What option with the iptables command creates a new chain?;iptables -N chain_name<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Create a new user-defined chain by the given name. There must be no target of that name already.<br /><br />

When the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one address, a rule will be added for each possible address combination.<br /><br />
956;;146;What option with the iptables command inserts rules into the chain?;iptables -I chain_name [rulenum] rule-specification<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number.&nbsp &nbsp So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are inserted at the head of the chain. This is also the default if no rule number is specified.<br /><br />
957;;146;What option with the iptables command replaces a rule in the chain?;iptables -R chain_name rulenum rule-specification<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Replace a rule in the selected chain. If the source and/or destination names resolve to multiple addresses, the command will fail. Rules are numbered starting at 1.
958;;146;What option with the iptables command deletes a rule from the chain?;iptables -D chain_name rule-specification<br>iptables -D chain_name rulenum<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Delete one or more rules from the selected chain. There are two versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a number in the chain (starting at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to match.
959;;146;What option with the iptables command deletes all the rules from the chain?;iptables -F <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given).

Only built-in (nonuser-defined) chains can have policies, and neither built-in nor user-defined chains can be policy targets.
961;;147;What option with the iptables command deletes an empty chain?;-X [chain]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Delete the optional user-defined chain specified. There must be no references to the chain. If there are, you must delete or replace the referring rules before the chain can be deleted.&nbsp &nbsp The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain any rules. If no argument is given, it will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table.<br><br />
962;;147;What option with the iptables command will zero the packet and byte counters in all rules in a chain?;-Z [chain [rulenum]]<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains, or only the given chain, or only the given rule in a chain. 
963;;147;What option with the iptables command will specify the protocol of the rule or packet to be checked?;-p protocol<br><br /><br>The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check. The specified protocol can be one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, esp, ah, sctp or the special keyword &quot all&quot , or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a different one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed. A &quot !&quot  argument before the protocol inverts the test.&nbsp &nbsp The number zero is the equivalent to all. An &quot all&quot  will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this option is omitted.<br><br />
964;;147;In iptables what are the options for specifying the source and destination address?;-s, --source address[/mask][,...]<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Source specification.

980;;68;What command is used to print or control the kernel ring buffer?;dmesg<br /><br />The kernel ring buffer is not really a log file per se, but rather an area in the running kernel you can query for kernel bootup messages via the dmesg utility.<br /><br />The default action is to read all messages from kernel ring buffer. Often the dmesg command is used with the grep command to pull smaller pieces of information. 
981;;69;What file contains firewall log entries?;/var/log/firewall
982;;69;What command reports the most recent login of all users or of a given user?<br><br />;lastlog<br><br /><br>The lastlog command formats and prints the contents of the last login log /var/log/lastlog file. The login-name, port, and last login time will be printed. The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries to be printed, sorted by their order in /etc/passwd.<br><br /><br>-u LOGIN|RANGE<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Print the lastlog record of the specified user(s).

990;;70;What are some of the facilities defined in the selectors section of the syslog.conf file?;authpriv<br /><br /><br />Used by all services associated with system security or authorization.<br /><br /><br />cron<br /><br /><br />Used by cron and at command.<br /><br /><br />daemon<br /><br /><br />Used by daemons that do not have their own facility.<br /><br /><br />kern<br /><br /><br />Used for all kernel log messages.<br /><br /><br />lpr<br /><br /><br />Used for messages from the printing system.<br /><br /><br />mail<br /><br /><br />Used for log messages from the MTA like postfix or sendmail.<br /><br /><br />news<br /><br /><br />Used for log messages from the news daemon.<br /><br /><br />syslog<br /><br /><br />Used for internal messages from the syslog daemon itself.<br /><br /><br />user<br /><br /><br />Used for user-related log messages.<br /><br /><br />uucp <br /><br /><br />Used for log message from the uucp daemon.<br /><br /><br />local0 - local7<br /><br /><br />Used for capturing log message from applications developed by the user or outside sources.<br /><br /><br /><br />
991;;70;What utility allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files?;logrotate<br /><br /><br />Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.<br /><br /><br />Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job. It will not modify a log more than once in one day unless the criterion for that log is based on the log's size and logrotate is being run more than once each day, or unless the -f or -force option is used.<br><br /><br>It's configuration file is under /etc/logrotate.conf.<br /><br />
992;;71;What are the three ways to forward logs in the syslog.conf/rsyslog.conf configuration file?;There are three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP transport, the plain TCP based transport and the RELP that is currently available only as part of rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above. To&nbsp &nbsp forward&nbsp &nbsp messages to another host via UDP, prepend the hostname with the at sign (&quot @&quot ).&nbsp &nbsp To forward it via plain tcp, prepend two at signs (&quot @@&quot ). To forward via RELP, prepend the string &quot :omrelp:&quot  in front of the&nbsp &nbsp hostname.<br><br /><br>Example for UDP: *.* @192.168.0.1<br><br /><br>Example for RELP: *.* :omrelp:192.168.0.1:2514<br><br />

994;;71;What shell command is an interface to the syslog system log module?;logger<br /><br />The basic syntax for logger is 'logger message'. It doesn't require any options if you're just going to write a static message to the logfile and you want to write to the default /var/log/messages at the &quot notice&quot  level. Some options are:<br /><br />-i<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Log the process ID of the logger process with each line.<br /><br />-f<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Log the contents of the specified file.<br /><br />-p<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br />Enter the message into the log with the specified priority.

1000;;50;What process is often called the super-server or internet super-server?;xinetd and inetd
1001;;50;What is the general purpose of inetd/xinetd?;When a connection is received by inetd/xinetd, it determines which program the connection is destined for, spawns the particular process and delegates the socket to it. Running inetd/xinetd for servers that are not heavily used can reduce the overall system load, when compared to running each daemon individually in stand-alone mode.<br /><br /><br />Primarily, inetd/xinetd is used to spawn other daemons, but several trivial protocols are handled directly
1002;;50;What are some of the network services that can be managed by inetd/xinetd?;chargen<br>daytime<br>echo<br>ftp<br>pop3<br>rsync<br>smtp<br>telnet<br>tftp<br>time<br>vnc<br>ssh
1003;;50;Often the /etc/xinetd.conf default configuration file is used. What directive allows xinetd to check other files and where?;In /etc/xinetd.conf you may find 'includedir /etc/xinetd.d' which tells the xinetd daemon to use the configuration files in /etc/xinetd.d. The files in this directory tel xinetd how to start each service when it is requested. 
1004;;50;What directive in the /etc/xinetd.d/ files tells xinetd whether or not xinetd is allowed to start the daemon when requested?;disable<br /><br />When set to 'yes' the daemon will not be started by xinetd when requested. When set to 'no' xinetd can start the daemon.<br /><br />What program to run is specified by the 'server = [directive]'.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />server&nbsp &nbsp =&nbsp &nbsp /usr/bin/vsftpd
1005;;51;What must you do after changing the values of any files in /etc/xinetd.d?;You should restart the xinetd daemon with <br><br /><br>/etc/rd.d/init.d<br><br /><br>or<br><br /><br>/etc/init.d
1006;;51;What are TCP wrappers?;TCP Wrapper is a host-based Networking ACL system used to filter network access.<br><br /><br>When a connection attempt is made to a TCP-wrapped service, the service first references the host's access files (/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny) to determine whether or not the client is allowed to connect. In most cases, it then uses the syslog daemon (syslogd) to write the name of the requesting client and the requested service to /var/log/secure or /var/log/messages. 
1007;;51;What are general steps for setting up TCP wrappers?;1. Install the tcpd daemon.<br /><br />2. Open the /etc/xinetd.d configuration file for the service you would like to control.<br /><br />3. Comment out the existing 'server =' line.<br /><br />4. Add the following example line instead:<br /><br />server = /usr/sbin/tcpd<br /><br />This forces xinetd to start tcpd daemon instead of the particular service.<br /><br />5. Add the line 'server_args = /path/to/service'<br /><br />Example: server_args = /usr/sbin/vsftpd<br /><br />6. Save the files and restart the xinetd daemon.<br /><br />7. Create your access controls in /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. The hosts.allow file is read first so it takes precedence. In general the /etc/hosts.deny file you deny all.<br /><br />service_name&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ALL<br /><br />Then you specify a specific allow in the /etc/hosts.allow.<br /><br />vsftpd: 192.168.1.1
1008;;51;What is the configuration file for the inetd daemon?;/etc/inetd.conf<br><br /><br>The inetd daemon in has mostly been replaced with xinetd. Unlike the xinetd daemon, all of the services managed by inetd are configure in the /etc/inetd.conf.
1009;;51;What is the syntax for the entries in the /etc/inetd.conf?;service_name socket_type protocol flags user executable arguments
1010;;19;What is the difference between symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption?;Symmetric encryption uses the same encryption key to encrypt and decrypt the message. The sender and receiver must use the same exact key. It tends to require less processing and as a result is often faster than asymmetric encryption.<br><br /><br>Asymmetric encryption uses two keys  one being private and one being public. Data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted only with the public key. Data encypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the private key. It tends to require more processing and as a result is often slower than symmetric encryption. 
1011;;19;What are some examples of cryptographic standards the use symmetric encryption?;Data Encryption Standard (DES)<br /><br /><br />DES uses a 56-bit key and uses the block cipher method, which breaks text into 64-bit blocks and then encrypts them.<br /><br /><br />Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES)<br /><br /><br />Triple DES uses a &quot key bundle&quot  which comprises three DES keys, K1, K2 and K3, each of 56 bits (excluding parity bits). It essentially runs DES three times to arrive at three different bit strengths of 56 bit, 112 bit, and 168 bit.<br /><br /><br />Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)<br /><br /><br />AES operates on a 4 x 4 matrix preforming a number of cycles depending on the key bit size. It does 10 cycles of repetition for 128 bit keys, 12 cycles of repetition for 192 bit keys and 14 cycles of repetition for 256 bit keys.<br /><br />Blowfish<br><br /><br>Blowfish is a public domain cipher. It has a 64-bit block size and a key length of anywhere from 32 bits to 448 bits. Notable features include a key-dependent S-boxes, a highly complex key schedule, and being one of the faster block ciphers. 
1012;;19;What are some examples of cryptographic standards that use asymmetric encryption?;Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)<br><br /><br>Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
1013;;19;What is a certificate authority?;A certificate authority is an entity or company that issues digital certificates to other entities to allow them to prove their identity to others. The digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. It either generates or uses a private key and a public key. The private key is not shared, but the public key is made available.
1014;;19;What information is contained in a certificate?;-- Name of the organization.<br /><br />-- Public key of the organization.<br /><br />-- Expiration date.<br /><br />-- Certificate serial number.<br /><br />-- Name of the signing Certificate Authority.<br /><br />-- The digital signature of the Certificate Authority.
1015;;21;What is the difference between an internal CA and a trusted CA?;Trusted Certificate Authorities provide public certificates that are used for example by browsers to form trust relations. They are provided by trusted third parties like VeriSign or Thawte. Often the certificates are updated using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OSCP).<br><br /><br>Internal Certificate Authorities are used primarily for private networks. They do not use public trusted third parties to form trust relations.
1016;;21;What is the general flow for public certificate use with web browser access?;1. The browser request the public key for example.com from an external public CA.<br /><br />2.

Entering a positive value will cause a process to lose priority. Conversely, a negative value will cause a process to be viewed more favorably by the kernel. This option is not available in secure mode. The superuser login is needed to enter a negative value.
1145;;59;What signal is sent when the key combination CTRL-C?;SIGINT
1146;;119;What do the numerical interactive signals of 1, 2, 9, 15, 18, and 20 do?;1, SIGHUP, The SIGHUP (“hang-up”) signal is used to report that the user's terminal is disconnected, perhaps because a network or telephone connection was broken. Sometimes this signal is used by a daemon to reread a configuration file. <br><br /><br>2, SIGINT, Interrupt and stop running. This signal is sent by CTRL-C.<br><br /><br>9, SIGKILL, The SIGKILL signal is used to cause immediate program termination. It cannot be handled or ignored, and is therefore always fatal. It is also not possible to block this signal. <br><br /><br>15, SIGTERM, The SIGTERM signal is a generic signal used to cause program termination. Unlike SIGKILL, this signal can be blocked, handled, and ignored. It is the normal way to politely ask a program to terminate gracefully.<br><br /><br>18, SIGCONT, The SIGCONT signal instructs the operating system to restart a process previously paused by the SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP signal. One important use of this signal is in job control in the Unix shell.<br><br /><br>20, SIGTSTP, The SIGTSTP signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal to request it to stop temporarily. It is commonly initiated by the user pressing Control-Z. Unlike SIGSTOP, the process can register a signal handler for or ignore the signal.
1147;;119;What command can stop a process and is implemented both in the shell built-in command and as a stand alone binary command?;kill

1150;;119;What is the strongest kill signal?;9) SIGKILL
1151;;120;Use kill to reread the httpd configuration file.;kill -HUP 'cat /var/run/httpd.pid'
1152;;120;What is the difference between the nice and renice command?;The nice command is used to start a command at a certain nice level. <br><br /><br>The renice command is used to modify the 'niceness' of a running process. 
1153;;120;What option with the renice command will target the specified users? How about a group?;-u, --user<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Force the who parameters to be interpreted as user names.<br><br /><br>-g, --pgrp<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Force who parameters to be interpreted as process group ID's.<br><br />
1154;;120;When specifying the nice value with the nice and renice command what is the difference in invocation?;The nice command uses a leading dash to the nice number. Therefore negative numbers could have a double dash. <br><br /><br>The renice command does not need the dash.
1155;;120;What regular expression position anchor will match word bounderies?;\&lt \&gt <br><br /><br>Word bounderies are defined as whitespace, the start of the line, the end of line, or punctuation marks. The backslashes are required and enable the interpretation of &lt  and &gt .
1156;;134;What are the three different versions fo regular expresssions grep understands?;The command grep understands three different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE)&nbsp &nbsp and “perl”&nbsp &nbsp (PRCE). In GNU grep, there is no difference in available functionality between basic and extended syntaxes. 
1157;;134;What regular expression matches empty characters?;The symbols \&lt  and \&gt  respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.&nbsp &nbsp The symbol \b matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and \B matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word.&nbsp &nbsp 
1158;;134;What simple regular expression can match a-z A-Z 0-9?;The symbol \w is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]]. The [[:alnum:]] character class represents alphabetic and numeric characters, and it is same as using [a-zA-Z0-9] in regular expression.
1159;;134;What meta-characters match an empty string and the beginning or end of the line?;The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively&nbsp &nbsp match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line. They are typically used for anchoring.<br /><br />
1160;;134;In basic regular expressions what must you do to maintain their special meaning?;Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning  instead use the backslashed versions \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).<br><br /><br>Traditional egrep did not support the { meta-character, and some egrep implementations support&nbsp &nbsp \{&nbsp &nbsp instead, so portable scripts should avoid { in grep -E patterns and should use [{] to match a literal {.<br><br /><br><br />
1161;;135;What option with the grep command will ignore case?;-i, --ignore-case<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input files.
